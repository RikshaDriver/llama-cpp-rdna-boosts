# rdna-boosts TODO / follow-up tracker

Cross-project tracker so important state survives context compaction.

**Forward-looking only.**  This file lists open work, items waiting on someone else, accepted limitations
and parked ideas.  **A closed or resolved item is not kept here** — it is one dated entry in
[`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md) plus the campaign record that entry points to (`archive/work/<campaign>/`).
Details never live here: they live in `AGENTS.md`, `patches/README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `WORKLOG.md`,
`GREEDY-PURITY.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md`, `wip/*` and `benchmarks/`.

**Numbers are never reused.**  `#NN` is a permanent handle: an old `WORKLOG.md` entry that cites `TODO #74`
still means the same subject after that item is closed and removed from this file.  New items append.

**Current state:** the **14-block V2.1 set** (block 00 + blocks 01-13) at fork point **`097cf33d9`**,
release **`v14-097cf33d9-r125`**.  `release.json` is the source of truth for the tip/tree and hashes; the
top of `WORKLOG.md` is the newest record.

## 96. The n-gram band clamp fires on a config whose slab declines (no arena) — GATING CORRECTNESS / PERF


**Status: open, reproduced 2026-10-24 (`WORKLOG.md` 261024.006).**  `common` clamps an enabled n-gram
speculator to `band - 1` in `common_init_from_params`, i.e. *before* `llama_init_from_model`; the
movable-boundary slab is only armed at model load and is created or declined at the first compute-buffer
allocation (`moe_cache_disable_streaming()` runs there).  So a host-expert config whose slab is armed and
then **declines** is clamped to 15 while it runs the streaming path with no arena — the class the issue-#214
reporter is in (12 GiB card, `the movable-boundary slab does NOT fit` + `moe_cache_disable_streaming`).
Repro on gfx1201: 35B-A3B UD Q4_K_M `-ngl 99 -ncmoe 40 --spec-type ngram-mod` with
`GGML_CUDA_SLAB_MIN_ARENA_MIB=999999` -> `draft length 64 -> 15` at 0.03.631 s, slab decline at 0.03.652 s.
Safe (a narrower verify is always valid) but it removes the wide-draft win that the no-arena path has
(2x R9700 control: 67.6 wide vs 52.2 capped t/s); workaround `LLAMA_SPEC_NGRAM_MOD_BAND_CLAMP=0`.

**Why it is not a one-liner.**  The clamp also sets `cparams.n_rs_batch` (the GDN rollback bound, and the
width the slab's narrow verify floor is measured at), so it must stay before context creation; a late
"un-clamp" would leave `n_rs_batch` too small for a 64-row verify on a GDN model.  Options:

1. **Split the two widths.**  Keep `n_rs_batch` at the safety bound (`common_speculative_n_max() + 1`, from
the *unclamped* config) and give the slab's narrow floor its own "expected verify width" parameter; clamp
the ngram draft after the context exists.  Costs ~5 GiB of arena on a real arena config only if the floor
keeps the wide width, so the floor must take the *clamped* width when the band is live — which is known
before context creation, so this works.  Largest change, correct for both regimes.
2. **Preflight feasibility test.**  The slab's three terms (work estimate, `SLAB_MIN_ARENA_MIB`, ring hole)
are all known at model load; only free VRAM is optimistic (KV/compute are not allocated yet), so the test
would miss configs like the reporter's that fit before KV.  Cheap, but would not have fixed this report.
3. **Accept and document.**  Keep the clamp, state that a slab-declined config is clamped (the README/§50
caveat already says so), and let the user set `LLAMA_SPEC_NGRAM_MOD_BAND_CLAMP=0`.  Zero risk; gives up the
no-arena wide draft for everyone on a small card.

Whichever is chosen, the slab-decline messages should name `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_MIN_ARENA_MIB` and
`GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RING_MIB`, not only `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RESERVE_MIB` (the reporter's binding constraint was the
ring hole: 768 + 2048 = 2816 MiB would have fit in the 3072 MiB available).

**Gates for any fix:** the reporter's class must keep `n_max 256` (no clamp line) and a real arena config
must still clamp (band 16 -> 15) with identical text/acceptance; `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh` is not
needed (no kernel change) but a same-seed coherence run on a GDN model with a 64-row verify is, to prove
`n_rs_batch` stayed >= the verify width.

## 97. Deep-context prefill: RDNA4 fixed in r126, the RDNA2 half of issue #214 open — PERFORMANCE / PLATFORM


**Status: open; the reporter's original symptom, never diagnosed until 2026-10-24.**  Issue #214's own summary
is "short-context prefill is much faster than upstream; full long prompts are slower", and their update
confirming the expert-cache arena never ran leaves exactly that.  Their numbers (RX 6700 XT 12 GB, gfx1031 as
gfx1030, `-ncmoe 24`, q8_0 K/V, `-ub 1024`): `pp512` **+63 %** at d0, +17 % at d32k, **-6 %** at d100k;
`read 3.8k` -6 %, `read 117k` **-19 %** (360 vs 443 t/s).  Constant token count with growing depth rules out
any per-token cost (host experts, MoE, the arena) and localises it to **attention / KV depth scaling**.

**Reproduced on gfx1201; the RDNA4 cause is fixed and shipped in r126 (2026-10-24, `WORKLOG.md` 261024.006 /
261024.007, `patches/README.md` block 05).**  Three
builds (r125, upstream at the fork point `097cf33d9`, upstream `master` `71255fefc`), 1 GPU, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
UD Q4_K_M fully resident, q8_0 K/V, `pp512 -n 0`: r125 4541 / 2488 / 1620 / **1210** t/s at
d0/32k/64k/98k vs upstream 2522-3600 / 2248-2273 / 1651-1661 / **1345-1366** -- our advantage decays with
depth and goes negative by 98k, on gfx1201 too, and upstream `master` is no better than the fork point at
depth.  The kernel trace put it in our FA launch geometry: the RDNA4 `ncols=64` **band** row was also the
prefill row (shared `__launch_bounds__` instantiation).  Deleting it (r126) measured 4624 / 2957 / 2023 /
**1632** t/s at d0/32k/64k/98k -- 20 % above upstream at d98k, with the d0 lead intact -- and the W=5..8
band arm unchanged within noise.  The reporter's streaming regime (`-ncmoe 24`, cache off) is *faster* than upstream at every depth on
this box (1223/1106/997/892 vs 983/884/775/694), so their -19 % is not the host-expert path.

**The RDNA2 half is still open, and it is not #98's row** (gfx1030 has no WMMA: its prefill takes the tile
kernel and the `get_config_rdna` table, where ncols 64 is 256 threads in both trees).  Candidates: block 05's
RDNA2 tile table from PR #165/r76 (per-DKQ configs, launch caps, WGP occupancy, the r99 checked tail -- never
depth-swept, and the RDNA2 validation makes no performance claim) and the
`prefill_stages = !RDNA3_5` FA-staging arch gate (RDNA3_5 measured native-better at every depth; RDNA2
never was); their 117k per-token costs (GDN/MMQ) are a separate additive term.

**Next:** the reporter's sweep (they offered) at `-p 512 -n 0 -d 0,8192,...,120000 -r 3` on both images with
their own flags, plus a `-ctk`/`-ctv f16` arm at a fitting context and a log grep for `FA prefill staging`
refusals (their peak was 12204 of 12272 MiB).  If the RDNA2 shape survives that, cut a comparable tile-table
A/B; no RDNA2 hardware here (`TODO #79`'s shortage applies).  Do **not** close this on a decode-side finding
again: the r123 band clamp is a decode/arena result and was never the reported symptom.

## 99. Restore the W=5..8 band geometry via a compile-time band instantiation — PERFORMANCE (parked)


**Status: parked 2026-10-24.**  r126 deleted the RDNA4 GQA-8/head-256 `ncols == 64` band row because it was
also the prefill row (`patches/README.md` block 05, `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §51).  The row gave the W=5..8 verify
band a 16-warp geometry (kernel-level ~17 % on q8_0 per its own comment), but when it was removed the
end-to-end decode on the measured arm did not move: 35B-A3B UD Q4_K_M, 1 GPU, `-ncmoe 40`, 32k context,
q8_0 K/V, recall prompt, `--spec-type draft-mtp` n_max 7: **248.8 / 239.6 t/s (r125) vs 241.2 / 249.7
(r126)**, and n_max 3 (which never used the row) **197.4 / 196.5 vs 196.8 / 197.2** -- noise either way, i.e.
the FA kernel is not the wall clock on a MoE-bound decode.  So this is only worth doing for a future
decode-bound workload (a dense head-256/GQA-8 model, or a much larger context).

If it is picked up: it cannot be a config row keyed on `ncols` -- `__launch_bounds__` is compiled per
instantiation and the same `ncols=64` kernel serves prefill.  Add a `bool band` template parameter (or reuse
the existing `band_fetch_ahead` machinery), thread it through the kernel's config getters, select it in the
host `case` only when `Q->ne[1] <= 8`, and keep prefill on the 256-thread table row.  It changes the band's
reduction order for W=5..8, so it owes `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh` for the prefill side (unchanged if
prefill keeps its row), the `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` oracle, and the MTP Protocol A acceptance arm.

## 79. RDNA3_0 verify-band fusions: the multi-device arm and gfx1101/gfx1102 are unmeasured — PLATFORM VALIDATION


**Status: open, accepted limitation.  Shipped default-on in r95 on the maintainer's decision**
(`WORKLOG.md` 261020.006, record `archive/work/rdna3-verify-fusions/RESOLUTION.md`).  Not a suspected
defect: the change is arch-identical code behind a host predicate and every single-GPU gate is green
(gfx1100 `W=1..8` maxdiff 0 on six model/prefix cells, `none == draft-mtp`, same-binary kill-switch
identity, prefill-logit KLD 0.000000).

Two gaps, both needing hardware the fleet does not have:

1. **RDNA3_0 multi-device.**  The batched f32 `GGML_OP_CPY` fusion is **not** single-device restricted and
   it is an actively used multi-device path: on 3x gfx1201 with the GDN model + MTP,
   `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH_DEBUG=1` shows **450 runs under `-sm layer` and 1350 under `-sm tensor`**.
   The RDNA4 multi-device path is therefore heavily exercised, but the same code on a 2+ card gfx1100
   box was never run.  What to run: a GDN model with MTP (`draft-mtp`, n-max 3) under both `-sm tensor`
   and `-sm layer`, plus `test-logits-width-probe` with `SPLIT=tensor`, comparing default against
   `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0`.  `fingon` is one gfx1100 plus a gfx1036 iGPU and `halo` is gfx1151, so
   neither is a valid host.  Community members running multiple gfx1100 cards are expected to report.
   If a multi-device failure does appear, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0` is the immediate workaround and
   restricting that fusion to `get_device_count() <= 1` on RDNA3_0 is the local fix.
2. **gfx1101 / gfx1102.**  `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0` covers `0x1100 <= cc < 0x1150`, so gfx1101 (RX
   7800 XT / 7700) and gfx1102 (RX 7600) take the same fusions, but neither the PR author nor the r95
   release ran them.  There is no such card in the fleet.  The same `W=1..8` probe and kill-switch A/B
   is the check if one becomes available.

**Do not re-report as a bug without one of those runs.**

## 70. Harden the expert-cache re-arm / wide-aux growth against a starved arena — ROBUSTNESS


Opened 2026-10-19 while fixing r87.  r87 forces the post-prefill drop, so the r86 trigger (the wide layout
was never released and the arena decayed) is gone.  But the failure shape was: a re-arm that had to shrink
one layer to a partial slot count (`layer=47 ... 344 requested, only 202 fit`), a starved wide-aux region
(thousands of `SLAB_WIDE_AUX` attempts), then a GPU page fault in `k_get_rows_float` on the next graph.
The re-arm is supposed to be layer-uniform and safe; make a partial/refused re-arm leave the cache
**wholesale stood down** (the fuse-guard invariant) instead of running a mixed-slot layer, and make the
wide-aux growth refuse once per pass instead of once per allocation.  Repro: the 10-prompt series against
r86 in `WORKLOG.md` 261019.002; validation arm `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_VALIDATE=1`.

**r94 note:** the issue #187 fix adds the missing *graph* half of this stale-pointer family — a captured
graph is now invalidated when the slab work boundary shrinks (block 10, `WORKLOG.md` 261020.004).  That
covers the observed #187 fault; it does **not** discharge this item, because a re-arm can still change a
table's arena placement under a graph that is not being dropped.  Keep #70 open.

## 36. Genuine CPU/GPU overlap for the MoE misses (Strata's pipeline shape) — PERFORMANCE (scoping)


Opened 2026-10-05.  The delivered cache-on path computes every expert on the GPU (resident from VRAM,
misses via UVA over PCIe); the cache-off path computes them on the CPU but **serialised** with the GPU
splits.  Our own CPU-computes-misses arm was correct and negative above a ~1.2 GiB arena (the loss is
~600 scheduler dispatches + ~3 cross-backend copies per layer/token, not CPU compute; see
`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/WORKLOG.md`).  Strata's custom engine runs the CPU pool *because* it is not
under llama.cpp's serial scheduler.  **Next:** O0 — measure how much of a 52 t/s token is the UVA cold
fraction at 43 % residency; if it is <20 %, park it.  Design space and gates:
[`wip/moe-cpu-overlap/`](wip/moe-cpu-overlap/README.md).

## Documented, deliberately NOT fixed (accepted limitations — do not re-report)


- **A Windows VRAM overcommit is not catchable: it surfaces as a device loss, not an allocation failure
  (issue #216, accepted; nothing in the delivery can change it).**  On WDDM an allocation set larger than
  the card does not fail, it pages into system memory; the first big prefill (a full `-ub` compute buffer
  plus the FA staging) then loses the device, and the process's *next* rocBLAS touch aborts with
  `rocBLAS error: Could not initialize Tensile host: No devices found` (rocBLAS's `TensileHost` prints
  that when `hipGetDeviceCount()` returns non-success; it allocates nothing on that path, so the message
  is a symptom, not an OOM inside rocBLAS).  Measured budget for the reported config (dense 27B IQ3_S,
  `-c 131072 -ctk q4_0 -ctv q4_0 -b 4096 -ub 1024` + MTP n3, no mmproj): **14.8 GiB** of static device
  memory and a **16.0-16.2 GiB** first-prefill peak on a headless 32 GiB card, against a 16 GiB card that
  also drives the display.  Mitigations shipped/to use: the draft KV follows the main KV type (r125,
  block 02, -368 MiB at `-c 131072`), `-c`, `-ub`, a real `-ngl` offload (`-ngl` is a **layer count** and
  a NextN model has `n_layer + 1` layers, so `-ngl 85` on a 65-layer model is a no-op), and letting
  `--fit` size the context (it declines when `-ngl` or `-c` is set).  Do not re-investigate the rocBLAS
  message as a delivery defect without a Windows event log showing a TDR (`4101`/`4102`) *absent* at the
  abort.

- **`std::min<int64_t>` / `std::max<int64_t>` in other HIP TUs is a latent Windows-only build failure
  (TODO #95, accepted; no Windows toolchain here).**  With HIP on Windows (clang + the MSVC STL) clang's
  force-included `cuda_wrappers/algorithm` and the MSVC STL `<utility>` each define an inline
  `std::min<long long>` under **one** mangled name (the `enable_if` that makes clang's win overload
  resolution is not part of the MSVC mangling), so a translation unit that instantiates both fails to
  codegen with *"definition with same mangled name"* — r123's `moe-expert-cache.cu` was the first to
  trigger it (issue #217, fixed in r124 with the local ternary helpers; see `patches/README.md` block 09).
  The reporter's toolchain builds every other TU, but ~10 of them still carry the int64_t pattern
  (`argmax.cu`, `cpy-batch.cu`, `fattn.cu`, `mmvf.cu`, `fattn-common.cuh`, `gated_delta_net.cu`, `top-k.cu`,
  `ssm-scan.cu`, `ggml-cuda.cu`, `hc-mix.cu`): the collision only fires where the STL's own instantiation is
  emitted too, which is a header-instantiation accident, not a property of the call.  Not proactively
  rewritten because a non-AMD/Windows claim cannot be validated on this box (scope policy: non-AMD backends
  are out of validation scope); if a Windows build log names one of them, apply the same two-line helper
  fix there and bump the release.  Do not re-report as a new defect without a Windows build log.

- **The Meta split-state lookup-count headroom (TODO #80) — retired 2026-10-24, accepted.**  The measured
  defect (issue #184: the pre-warm walk allocating one heap node per visited tensor on every graph
  re-allocation) was fixed in r100 (block 09, `GGML_META_SS_SCRATCH`, default on).  What remained is the
  reporter's ~165k cache hits per re-allocation (30+ per node), and the only lever is the lookup **count**
  (the recursion/pruning structure of `calculate_split_state` and the pre-warm walk) — hashing the cached
  336-byte `ggml_tensor` copy to skip the `memcmp` costs about what the `memcmp` costs.  Not pursued because
  the frequency that makes it worth anything is his workload: it re-allocates **~230** graphs per run, while
  the delivery's own validated shapes re-allocate **3** in a whole 4-stream x 192-token Flash-Next IQ3_XXS
  + MTP window (`-sm tensor -ncmoe 47`, 63 graph reuses per stream; 4B Q8_0 2-GPU tensor: 12 in 4 x 128),
  so even at his own post-r100 16.0 ms per re-allocation the whole walk is at most ~1 % of a 4.2 s window
  and the lookup-count share of that is below this box's noise floor (r100's entire heap-churn removal
  measured +0.29 % on this shape).  Issue #184 is closed (2026-10-21) with the reporter confirming r100 in
  his production build (+1.6 % 4-stream decode, identical greedy output), and the walk's code is unchanged
  since r100.  A future change there still owes the r100 proof set (identical states under
  `GGML_META_SS_VERIFY=1`, identical greedy text and prefill KLD, same-binary A/B with
  `GGML_META_SS_SCRATCH=0`).  Records: `archive/work/issue-184-meta-r80r82/RESOLUTION.md` (addendum) +
  `probe-reallocs.py`, `WORKLOG.md` 261024.003.
- **`mmf32` covers the skinny F32 shapes only (r104, `TODO` #82 closed) — accepted.**  A full-F32 model's FFN
  GEMMs (`m` ≫ 256: dense F32/F16-weights-heavy prefill) still fall through to rocBLAS/hipBLASLt, so they keep
  that path's per-start solution lottery; the kernel's tile (32 output rows) is the wrong shape to be
  competitive there and no such model is validated.  Also untouched: BF16/f16 prefill (Flash-Next keeps both
  hipBLASLt's +51 % and its own lottery — a BF16 counterpart is its own job) and **RDNA3** (gfx1100), where the
  kernel stays opt-in (`GGML_CUDA_MMF32=1`) because it measured −1.3…−2.2 % at `pp2048` there; the lever would be
  a per-arch tile, not the gate.  RDNA3_5 was admitted and is default-on since r105 (`halo`: 12/12
  deterministic, +1.0 %/+1.6 % prefill, family-switch PASS).  Scope: `patches/README.md` (block 06), rule:
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §47.
- **The `launch-ledger` remainder (item 5(c)) — measured, not pursued (2026-09-12 (8)).**  The small-pp
  remainder (+38 `scale_f32`/eval, an `rms_norm<256,true>` count diff) is sub-0.2 %, root-cause-only.
- **The mmq mma `sum[]` accumulator-overflow latent defect (item 5(d)) — accepted, no upstream report
  (2026-09-12 (8)).**  `process_tile` sizes the per-thread accumulator as `J*I/(nwarps*32)` while the
  AMD-WMMA vec_dot indexes up to `J/2-1`, so any config with `I < nwarps*16` silently corrupts
  (deterministic for J=128, racy for J=48/24).  Root cause + full evidence matrix:
  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-06-strix-halo-gfx1151-mmq-j128-latent-defect.md`.
  Upstream ships **no** violating config (every `mmq-config-*.cuh` row keeps `I >= nwarps*16`) and the
  block-13 rows never violate it either, so there is no upstream reproducer to file.
- **V3 prefill cost is arch-dependent (item 5(g)) — accepted.**  gfx1151 measured −3.2 % at pp20480 (4B,
  q8_0) vs the RDNA4 reference −1.3 %, decode flat; still a large net win (−799 MiB compute + −799 MiB
  host) and on by default.
- **Upstream monitor: ROCm unaligned-width split-load (item 13) — standing, no action (2026-09-12 (8)).**
  Fixed locally in block 13; no PR planned (upstream is busy with its own qwen4exp work).  It resolves
  naturally as a re-base conflict if upstream fixes it; nothing to track.
- **Mixed K/V cache types are HARD-REJECTED.**  Every mixed pair (`bf16`+`q8_0`, `f16`+`q8_0`) measured
  1.7-3.6× slower and never smaller; `params.type_k != params.type_v` fails `llama_init_from_model` with
  a message naming both types (block-14 amendment; upstream's MLA/DeepSeek4-only condition is dropped).
  Both types default to f16, so only an explicit `-ctk`/`-ctv` can trigger it.
- **gemma-4-E4B-it + 3-GPU `-sm tensor`** aborts in the meta splitter because its 2 KV heads are fewer
  than the 3 devices (one device gets a zero-extent share: `[1, 1, 0]` over 2 heads).  The abort is the
  split-state **ratio-consistency** assert in `ggml_backend_meta_get_split_state`
  (`split_state.ne[j]*split_state.nr[0] * tensor->src[i]->ne[src_ss[i].axis] == sum * tensor->ne[split_state.axis]`
  — `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`; 1582 at r101, 1487 at r99: the line number moves, the assert does not, and
  older records that cite `:1177` are one more tree back).  Works on 1/2 GPUs and on 3 GPUs with
  `-sm layer`; maintainer's call: no fix.  r101's split-state work deliberately does not change this
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45 accepts a slice that is *empty or the whole* extent, and one head of two is
  neither); re-verified on r99 and r101, identical abort.  Every other model is unaffected (a future
  block or upstream report could make the splitter tolerate a zero-extent share).
- **`src/llama-kv-cache.h:274` `-Wunused-private-field` for `v_enabled`** on a full build (the field *is*
  used, in `llama-kv-cache.cpp:232`; clang's per-TU analysis fires).  A `[[maybe_unused]]` one-liner
  silences it; left alone to keep the V5 amendment scoped to the FA kernels.
- **Gemma4's full-attention (head_dim 512) layers stay outside the rope + FWHT + KV-write fusion**
  (documented 2026-10-21, deliberate).  The fused kernel instantiates `fwht_n` in `{64, 128, 256}`, and
  Gemma4 is the only arch with a distinct SWA/full head dim (`key_length_swa` 256 vs `key_length` 512),
  so its 1/6 full-attention layers run `rms_norm_mul_rope_f32<256,true,float,0,false>` + `fwht_cuda<512>`
  for Q and K plus two `set_rows` — 6 launches instead of 2.  Extending it needs 4 new kernel
  instantiations **and** a fix to the fused kernel's V-row write (its `ncols <= block_size` precondition
  would quantize half a 512-wide V row), which edits the shipping 256 fold, for ~0.1 % on gfx1201.
  Accepted as a gap; the analysis (what to change, why the arithmetic is bit-identical by construction)
  is in [`archive/work/fix-gemma-4/ISWA-WRITE-FUSION.md`](archive/work/fix-gemma-4/ISWA-WRITE-FUSION.md) §5.6.
  (The iSWA builder order that made the 256-wide half of this fusion live is r101, `WORKLOG.md` 261021.003;
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45 records the split-state rule that came with it.)
- **3-GPU plain (non-speculative) decode is a few percent slower than 2-GPU — accepted (this closes
  `TODO #51`; 2026-10-23, `archive/work/three-gpu-performance/RESOLUTION.md`).**  −2.0 % with a fully-resident
  arena (the 3-device internal all-reduce is 1.2 % of decode and no backend/size knob beats it), −10.5 % at
  91 % residency (the non-identity per-token routing readback, paid per device; the *marginal*-arena case is
  fixed in r117, an 8 %-short one is not), −10.2 % with
  `-sm layer` (no intra-token parallelism; a property of layer splitting, reproduced on dense 27B).
  Speculative decode does **not** lose: +14…+23 % at 3 devices when resident.  Production rule: 3 GPUs for
  speculative/MTP workloads, 2 GPUs for plain decode at partial residency, never `-sm layer` for decode.
- **Not worth pursuing** (measured, no win): the decode fq-inline-quantize port (wash-to-negative — the
  tree already launches fewer kernels/step and sits at wall parity) and the GDN +72-launch 2-kernel split
  (cosmetic).
- **`--spec-draft-mtp-vocab` two-band subset (closed 2026-10-22, measured, not shipped).**  A second band
  (keep `< N` **and** `>= n_vocab - M`) was meant to catch gemma4's space-piece band (229376..255999): it
  measured 0.610 acceptance at 37 % of the rows and was still 0.4 % *slower* on that payload.  With the
  width rule found in the 3-GPU arm (`N · n_devices < n_vocab`) a second band only makes the **mirrored**
  draft matmul wider, so it is a non-goal, not a parked idea.  Record:
  `archive/work/spec-draft-mtp-vocab/VALIDATION-2026-10-22.md` §5.
