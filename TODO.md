# rdna-boosts TODO / follow-up tracker

Cross-project tracker so important state survives context compaction.

**Forward-looking only.**  This file lists open work, items waiting on someone else, accepted limitations
and parked ideas.  **A closed or resolved item is not kept here** — it is one dated entry in
[`WORKLOG.md`](WORKLOG.md) plus the campaign record that entry points to (`archive/work/<campaign>/`).
Details never live here: they live in `AGENTS.md`, `patches/README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `WORKLOG.md`,
`GREEDY-PURITY.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md`, `wip/*` and `benchmarks/`.

**Numbers are never reused.**  `#NN` is a permanent handle: an old `WORKLOG.md` entry that cites `TODO #74`
still means the same subject after that item is closed and removed from this file.  New items append.

**Current state:** the **12-block V2.0 set** (block 00 + blocks 01-11) at fork point **`097cf33d9`**,
release **`v12-097cf33d9-r106`**.  `release.json` is the source of truth for the tip/tree and hashes; the
top of `WORKLOG.md` is the newest record.

Accepted limitations that are deliberately **not** fixed are listed at the end — do not re-report them.

## 36. Genuine CPU/GPU overlap for the MoE misses (Strata's pipeline shape) — PERFORMANCE (scoping)

Opened 2026-10-05.  The delivered cache-on path computes every expert on the GPU (resident from VRAM,
misses via UVA over PCIe); the cache-off path computes them on the CPU but **serialised** with the GPU
splits.  Our own CPU-computes-misses arm was correct and negative above a ~1.2 GiB arena (the loss is
~600 scheduler dispatches + ~3 cross-backend copies per layer/token, not CPU compute; see
`archive/work/moe-expert-cache/WORKLOG.md`).  Strata's custom engine runs the CPU pool *because* it is not
under llama.cpp's serial scheduler.  **Next:** O0 — measure how much of a 52 t/s token is the UVA cold
fraction at 43 % residency; if it is <20 %, park it.  Design space and gates:
[`wip/moe-cpu-overlap/`](wip/moe-cpu-overlap/README.md).

## 51. 3-GPU decode is slower than 2-GPU (MTP and plain, partial and fully resident) — PERFORMANCE

Reopened 2026-10-16; measured.  Formerly closed at r55 (a fresh A/B then found 3-GPU MTP 74.3 vs 2-GPU
65.0 t/s).  A 2026-10-16 measurement on r73 found the opposite: 2-GPU **84.4** vs 3-GPU **56.9** t/s
(13.8K prompt, GSQ-IQ3_XXS, `-ncmoe 48 -sm tensor`, adaptive MTP), and it is present at **100 % arena
residency** (so not an arena-sizing artifact).  3-GPU prefill is the fastest (1258 t/s).  Broader than MTP
(the fresh arm is MTP; the matrix must cover plain and fully-resident too).

Working home [`wip/three-gpu-performance/`](wip/three-gpu-performance/README.md) (revived 2026-10-16 from the
r55 `mtp-3gpu-decode` campaign; that campaign's r55 closure record moved with it and is kept beside the
README as `RESOLUTION-2026-10-13-closed.md`).  Step 0: re-run the r55 harness on the current tree, then the full
`{2,3}` x `{plain,MTP}` x `{partial,fully-resident}` x `{tensor,layer}` grid, then the all-reduce /
identity-path / tensor-split-gather profile.

## 55. Remove the full pinned `ROCm_Host` master when `--host-experts pool` is on — MEMORY

Opened 2026-10-11; scoping.  The r49 mmap reclaim (block 06) removed the mmap half of the `-ncmoe` host
peak, but `--host-experts pool` still keeps the **full pinned master** (r35 shipped the pool as a bounce
tier; the source logs "Phase 2b; full pinned master kept").  `RssShmem` is identical with and without the
pool: 18.7 GiB on 35B-A3B `-ncmoe 40`, 54.1 GiB on Flash-Next IQ4_NL `-ncmoe 40`.  Dropping the master is
the strongest lever for the **memory-pressure** half of issue #139 (the amdgpu driver stops all of a
process's GPU queues when the kernel migrates a GPU-mapped host page); the AR timeout itself was fixed in
**r59** (block 01, wall-clock soft/hard spin deadlines), so the remaining value here is fewer stalls, not a
correctness fix.  Working home [`wip/host-expert-master-drop/`](wip/host-expert-master-drop/README.md)
(gates and the reader enumeration are in that README).

## 59. `ngram-mod` + `draft-mtp-adaptive` halves decode with host-resident MoE experts — PERFORMANCE

Opened 2026-10-14; scoping.  With partially or fully host-resident MoE experts (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`, the
expert cache or op-offload path active), the README's recommended
`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive,ngram-mod` combo roughly **halves decode throughput**; dropping
`ngram-mod` and using plain `draft-mtp-adaptive` restores the expected rate.  The combo is the measured
best on a fully device-resident model, so the interaction is with the host-expert serve path.  Documented
in the README "Recommended configuration" section.  Working home
[`wip/ngram-mod-host-experts/`](wip/ngram-mod-host-experts/README.md) (hypotheses: verify width against the
per-op host-expert upload, the MoE cache band and verify graph recapture, the staging-ring width; bisect
plan in that README).

## 61. MoE expert-cache coverage: heat-map correctness, capacity allocation, offline replay — PERFORMANCE

Retargeted 2026-10-17 (was "hotness-aware arena placement + idle repack").  Three results of the
2026-10-17 review closed the old premise and opened this one
([`wip/moe-cache-coverage/FINDINGS-2026-10-17-coverage-vs-defrag.md`](wip/moe-cache-coverage/FINDINGS-2026-10-17-coverage-vs-defrag.md)):

1. **The heat map doubled per flush** — fixed in r80 (block 09: delta merge + a degenerate-map guard);
   the poisoned sidecars were deleted.
2. **Defrag/repack is not the lever**: the arena is ~100 % allocated in slots (0.51 % truncation) and
   eviction churn is 3.0 % of reaches, so an idle repack recovers ≤ 0.5 % of bytes while invalidating
   captured graphs and the arena address in kernel launch params (old phases 3-4 are closed).
3. **The Strata hit-rate gap is accounting + arena size**, not fragmentation: on equal accounting 91.9 %
   vs our 90.6 % on the same model, and the residual is 25.46 vs 15.30 GiB of arena.

**Open work** (`wip/moe-cache-coverage/`): (a) an **offline routing-trace replayer** (`MOE_EXPERT_TRACE` +
a policy scorer — we have only an aggregate heat vector, which cannot answer thrash/prefetch/window
questions); (b) a **per-layer capacity quota** from heat (uniform slots per table give up only 0.3-0.5 pts
on a uniformly-tallied map; the 1.5-1.9 pts seen on the 35B-A3B sidecars was the #64.2 tally-gap artifact)
— the only strictly-inside-the-arena win, and a small one; (c) metric parity (report covered mass +
expert MiB/token beside `h`).  The **arena size** lever (the slab's 8 GiB compute reserve + 4 GiB VA
spare, worth +3-6 pts of coverage) belongs to `archive/work/slab-transient-absorption/`, not here.

## 64. MoE heat-map residuals (pool warm order, decode-identity tally, dead `moe_cache_observe`) — MINOR

The heat map itself is promoted (r60, `WORKLOG.md` 261014.005).  Three residuals were deliberately left out:

1. **`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_PREFILL_SEED` is still dead (F1/F6).**  The in-run `prefill_count` tally is gated
   on `!g_sized` and the staged prefill path never reaches the host hook, so `pool_prepopulate_locked`
   warms the `--host-experts pool` pinned tier in **expert-id order** and `pool_rerank_from_tally_locked`
   remains an **uncalled function**.  The heat vector now covers the arena seed, so this is only the
   host-pool warm order (and the dead function) — a small fix.
2. **Decode-identity heat gap.**  A fully-resident table's decode traffic is still not tallied (the
   identity take-over short-circuits `access_locked`); the prefill tally is a good proxy (measured), so a
   sampled decode tally is optional polish.
3. **`moe_cache_observe` is dead code** (superseded by `moe_cache_heat_observe`): remove it or wire it.

Record: `archive/work/moe-heatmap-persistence/` (`RESOLUTION.md` lists these).

## 65. IQ4_NL field (MTP) + `--host-experts pool` decode collapses — MEMORY

The Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ4_NL 70K field config (`--n-cpu-moe 48`, MTP n7, `--cache-ram 16384`) decodes at
**2.1 t/s** in `--host-experts pool` against the handover's recorded 13.7, while prefill is fine (**497**),
the H2D ring is armed and there are **0 faults**.  The non-MTP `-ncmoe 36/48` pool decode (18-40) matches
the handover's ~2.4x pool penalty, so this reads as a **pool memory shortfall** specific to the 70K/MTP
config.  Parked by the maintainer (2026-10-15) to be picked up after r67; that release is long superseded
(r99 is current) and the item has not been picked up, so it stays parked until the maintainer says
otherwise.  `WORKLOG.md` 261015.005.


## 70. Harden the expert-cache re-arm / wide-aux growth against a starved arena — ROBUSTNESS

Opened 2026-10-19 while fixing r87.  r87 forces the post-prefill drop, so the r86 trigger (the wide layout
was never released and the arena decayed) is gone.  But the failure shape was: a re-arm that had to shrink
one layer to a partial slot count (`layer=47 ... 344 requested, only 202 fit`), a starved wide-aux region
(thousands of `SLAB_WIDE_AUX` attempts), then a GPU page fault in `k_get_rows_float` on the next graph.
The re-arm is supposed to be layer-uniform and safe; make a partial/refused re-arm leave the cache
**wholesale stood down** (the fuse-guard invariant) instead of running a mixed-slot layer, and make the
wide-aux growth refuse once per pass instead of once per allocation.  Repro: the 10-prompt series against
r86 in `WORKLOG.md` 261019.002; validation arm `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_VALIDATE=1`.

**r94 note:** the issue #187 fix adds the missing *graph* half of this stale-pointer family — a captured
graph is now invalidated when the slab work boundary shrinks (block 10, `WORKLOG.md` 261020.004).  That
covers the observed #187 fault; it does **not** discharge this item, because a re-arm can still change a
table's arena placement under a graph that is not being dropped.  Keep #70 open.

## 79. RDNA3_0 verify-band fusions: the multi-device arm and gfx1101/gfx1102 are unmeasured — PLATFORM VALIDATION

**Status: open, accepted limitation.  Shipped default-on in r95 on the maintainer's decision**
(`WORKLOG.md` 261020.006, record `archive/work/rdna3-verify-fusions/RESOLUTION.md`).  Not a suspected
defect: the change is arch-identical code behind a host predicate and every single-GPU gate is green
(gfx1100 `W=1..8` maxdiff 0 on six model/prefix cells, `none == draft-mtp`, same-binary kill-switch
identity, prefill-logit KLD 0.000000).

Two gaps, both needing hardware the fleet does not have:

1. **RDNA3_0 multi-device.**  The batched f32 `GGML_OP_CPY` fusion is **not** single-device restricted and
   it is an actively used multi-device path: on 3x gfx1201 with the GDN model + MTP,
   `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH_DEBUG=1` shows **450 runs under `-sm layer` and 1350 under `-sm tensor`**.
   The RDNA4 multi-device path is therefore heavily exercised, but the same code on a 2+ card gfx1100
   box was never run.  What to run: a GDN model with MTP (`draft-mtp`, n-max 3) under both `-sm tensor`
   and `-sm layer`, plus `test-logits-width-probe` with `SPLIT=tensor`, comparing default against
   `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0`.  `fingon` is one gfx1100 plus a gfx1036 iGPU and `halo` is gfx1151, so
   neither is a valid host.  Community members running multiple gfx1100 cards are expected to report.
   If a multi-device failure does appear, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0` is the immediate workaround and
   restricting that fusion to `get_device_count() <= 1` on RDNA3_0 is the local fix.
2. **gfx1101 / gfx1102.**  `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0` covers `0x1100 <= cc < 0x1150`, so gfx1101 (RX
   7800 XT / 7700) and gfx1102 (RX 7600) take the same fusions, but neither the PR author nor the r95
   release ran them.  There is no such card in the fleet.  The same `W=1..8` probe and kill-switch A/B
   is the check if one becomes available.

**Do not re-report as a bug without one of those runs.**

---

## Documented, deliberately NOT fixed (accepted limitations — do not re-report)

- **`mmf32` covers the skinny F32 shapes only (r104, `TODO` #82 closed) — accepted.**  A full-F32 model's FFN
  GEMMs (`m` ≫ 256: dense F32/F16-weights-heavy prefill) still fall through to rocBLAS/hipBLASLt, so they keep
  that path's per-start solution lottery; the kernel's tile (32 output rows) is the wrong shape to be
  competitive there and no such model is validated.  Also untouched: BF16/f16 prefill (Flash-Next keeps both
  hipBLASLt's +51 % and its own lottery — a BF16 counterpart is its own job) and **RDNA3** (gfx1100), where the
  kernel stays opt-in (`GGML_CUDA_MMF32=1`) because it measured −1.3…−2.2 % at `pp2048` there; the lever would be
  a per-arch tile, not the gate.  RDNA3_5 was admitted and is default-on since r105 (`halo`: 12/12
  deterministic, +1.0 %/+1.6 % prefill, family-switch PASS).  Scope: `patches/README.md` (block 06), rule:
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §47.
- **The `launch-ledger` remainder (item 5(c)) — measured, not pursued (2026-09-12 (8)).**  The small-pp
  remainder (+38 `scale_f32`/eval, an `rms_norm<256,true>` count diff) is sub-0.2 %, root-cause-only.
- **The mmq mma `sum[]` accumulator-overflow latent defect (item 5(d)) — accepted, no upstream report
  (2026-09-12 (8)).**  `process_tile` sizes the per-thread accumulator as `J*I/(nwarps*32)` while the
  AMD-WMMA vec_dot indexes up to `J/2-1`, so any config with `I < nwarps*16` silently corrupts
  (deterministic for J=128, racy for J=48/24).  Root cause + full evidence matrix:
  `archive/work/wip-archive/qwen4exp/discovery/2026-09-06-strix-halo-gfx1151-mmq-j128-latent-defect.md`.
  Upstream ships **no** violating config (every `mmq-config-*.cuh` row keeps `I >= nwarps*16`) and the
  block-13 rows never violate it either, so there is no upstream reproducer to file.
- **V3 prefill cost is arch-dependent (item 5(g)) — accepted.**  gfx1151 measured −3.2 % at pp20480 (4B,
  q8_0) vs the RDNA4 reference −1.3 %, decode flat; still a large net win (−799 MiB compute + −799 MiB
  host) and on by default.
- **Upstream monitor: ROCm unaligned-width split-load (item 13) — standing, no action (2026-09-12 (8)).**
  Fixed locally in block 13; no PR planned (upstream is busy with its own qwen4exp work).  It resolves
  naturally as a re-base conflict if upstream fixes it; nothing to track.
- **Mixed K/V cache types are HARD-REJECTED.**  Every mixed pair (`bf16`+`q8_0`, `f16`+`q8_0`) measured
  1.7-3.6× slower and never smaller; `params.type_k != params.type_v` fails `llama_init_from_model` with
  a message naming both types (block-14 amendment; upstream's MLA/DeepSeek4-only condition is dropped).
  Both types default to f16, so only an explicit `-ctk`/`-ctv` can trigger it.
- **gemma-4-E4B-it + 3-GPU `-sm tensor`** aborts in the meta splitter because its 2 KV heads are fewer
  than the 3 devices (one device gets a zero-extent share: `[1, 1, 0]` over 2 heads).  The abort is the
  split-state **ratio-consistency** assert in `ggml_backend_meta_get_split_state`
  (`split_state.ne[j]*split_state.nr[0] * tensor->src[i]->ne[src_ss[i].axis] == sum * tensor->ne[split_state.axis]`
  — `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`; 1582 at r101, 1487 at r99: the line number moves, the assert does not, and
  older records that cite `:1177` are one more tree back).  Works on 1/2 GPUs and on 3 GPUs with
  `-sm layer`; maintainer's call: no fix.  r101's split-state work deliberately does not change this
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45 accepts a slice that is *empty or the whole* extent, and one head of two is
  neither); re-verified on r99 and r101, identical abort.  Every other model is unaffected (a future
  block or upstream report could make the splitter tolerate a zero-extent share).
- **`src/llama-kv-cache.h:274` `-Wunused-private-field` for `v_enabled`** on a full build (the field *is*
  used, in `llama-kv-cache.cpp:232`; clang's per-TU analysis fires).  A `[[maybe_unused]]` one-liner
  silences it; left alone to keep the V5 amendment scoped to the FA kernels.
- **Gemma4's full-attention (head_dim 512) layers stay outside the rope + FWHT + KV-write fusion**
  (documented 2026-10-21, deliberate).  The fused kernel instantiates `fwht_n` in `{64, 128, 256}`, and
  Gemma4 is the only arch with a distinct SWA/full head dim (`key_length_swa` 256 vs `key_length` 512),
  so its 1/6 full-attention layers run `rms_norm_mul_rope_f32<256,true,float,0,false>` + `fwht_cuda<512>`
  for Q and K plus two `set_rows` — 6 launches instead of 2.  Extending it needs 4 new kernel
  instantiations **and** a fix to the fused kernel's V-row write (its `ncols <= block_size` precondition
  would quantize half a 512-wide V row), which edits the shipping 256 fold, for ~0.1 % on gfx1201.
  Accepted as a gap; the analysis (what to change, why the arithmetic is bit-identical by construction)
  is in [`archive/work/fix-gemma-4/ISWA-WRITE-FUSION.md`](archive/work/fix-gemma-4/ISWA-WRITE-FUSION.md) §5.6.
  (The iSWA builder order that made the 256-wide half of this fusion live is r101, `WORKLOG.md` 261021.003;
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45 records the split-state rule that came with it.)
- **Not worth pursuing** (measured, no win): the decode fq-inline-quantize port (wash-to-negative — the
  tree already launches fewer kernels/step and sits at wall parity) and the GDN +72-launch 2-kernel split
  (cosmetic).

## 80. Meta split-state cache: 30+ lookups per node per re-allocation — PERFORMANCE (parked)

r100 removed the walk's heap churn (block 09, issue #184: `wstack`/`wseen` on a reused per-thread
`monotonic_buffer_resource`).  What is left per graph re-allocation, on the reporter's 4-stream workload, is
~165k cache hits -- **more than 30 per node** -- each a hash find on the tensor pointer plus a 336-byte
`memcmp` of the cached `ggml_tensor` copy.

Parked, not attempted: hashing the tensor bytes to skip the `memcmp` would cost about what the `memcmp`
costs (336 B is ~11 vector words), so the lever is the lookup **count** (the recursion/pruning structure of
`calculate_split_state` and the pre-warm walk), not the comparison.  Any change there needs the same proof
the r100 change used: identical states under `GGML_META_SS_VERIFY=1`, identical greedy text and prefill
KLD, and a same-binary A/B (`GGML_META_SS_SCRATCH=0` is the adjacent switch).  Measurements and the
reporter's numbers: `archive/work/issue-184-meta-r80r82/RESOLUTION.md`.
