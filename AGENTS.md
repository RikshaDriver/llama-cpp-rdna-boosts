# AGENTS.md — working in this repo

This guide is for humans AND LLM coding agents. Read it before changing anything in
`~/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts/` (or acting on its behalf). It is deliberately short: policies, hard
invariants and pointers only. The dated record lives in `WORKLOG.md` (newest first) and `archive/`;
the pre-2026-10-04 AGENTS.md is preserved verbatim in `archive/docs/AGENTS-HISTORY.md`.

**Current state:** `release.json` is the single source of truth (fork point, canonical tip/tree,
block count, per-artifact sha256); the top of `WORKLOG.md` is the newest dated record. Do not restate
release history here — this file is the policy layer, not the log.

## What this repo is

A **delivery repo**. It packages the RDNA/ROCm work of the [`stew675/llama.cpp`](https://github.com/stew675/llama.cpp)
fork (`rdna-boosts` branch) as a **14-block set (V2.1)** (block 00 + blocks 01-13) that applies to a clean
llama.cpp checkout at the fork point named in `release.json`. This repo is NOT the fork: the fork
lives at `~/llama.cpp`; its `rdna-boosts` branch is re-cut from `patches/` on every release and
force-pushed to the personal fork so it never goes stale (see the Pushing policy). `patches/` is the
deliverable; `scripts/` is the apply/regenerate/validate flow; `README.md`
is the consumer overview; `MANIFESTS.md` is the apply order + verification contract, `BASELINE.md` the
provenance + drift policy (both are contracts now — their dated history is in `archive/docs/`);
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` is
the purity rulebook.

## Report findings before shipping (MANDATORY)

Surface review findings, open questions and small nits to the maintainer **before** any
delivery-affecting commit and **before** any release or tag, and wait for a decision. Do not bury them
in a commit message, a post-push summary or a GitHub reply. If something turns up mid-flight, stop and
ask instead of finishing the release and mentioning it afterwards. The maintainer decides whether a
finding is fixed now, deferred or dropped, and the decision is recorded (a `TODO.md` item, a block
amendment, or a note in the relevant record).

## Pushing policy (MANDATORY — read before any `git push`)

**Never push to upstream llama.cpp.** The only permitted push targets are this repo (the delivery,
`github.com:stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts`) and the maintainer's personal fork
(`git@github.com:stew675/llama.cpp.git`). A bare `git push` in `~/llama.cpp` targets upstream
`ggml-org/llama.cpp` — never acceptable; repeated attempts can get the account banned.

- All deliverable changes live in THIS repo (`llama-cpp-rdna-boosts`) as the `patches/` set. That is
  the primary thing that gets pushed.
- **Every release MUST refresh the fork's `rdna-boosts` branch.**  Consumers clone the personal fork
  and check out `rdna-boosts` instead of applying the patch set, so a stale branch is what produced
  the 2026-10 Reddit "rdna-boosts is slow" incident (the branch was a month behind).  On every
  release (and whenever the block set changes), do a clean apply and push the branch:
  1. In a clean `~/llama.cpp`, check out upstream `master` at the **baseline point** — the `.base`
     commit in `release.json`, never the tip of `master`.
  2. Delete the existing `rdna-boosts` branch and re-create it with `scripts/apply-all.sh` (strict
     `git am`; the applied tree must equal `release.json`'s `.tree`).
  3. Build it and run the coherence + MTP gates and `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh`; `scripts/validate-set.sh` must be green.
  4. `git push --force-with-lease origin rdna-boosts` — the **personal fork only**, never upstream;
     never a bare `--force`.
- **Every release MUST also publish the ROCm container images.**  They are built and pushed
  **off-host** by the worker watcher (`scripts/container-watch.sh` on `radiance`), which polls for the
  new release tag and runs `scripts/build-containers.sh --rocm "7.14.1 10.1" --push --prune`; see
  `CONTAINERS.md` → "Offload the image build to a worker".  **Do not run the full container image build
  (all targets, both ROCm lines) on the primary box during a release**: it pins all cores for tens of
  minutes and contaminates any benchmark running beside it.  Nothing here changes the normal local
  **source** build for testing and development (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm`, Common tasks → "Build the
  fork"), which stays on the primary box.  The local `scripts/build-containers.sh` is for a smoke test or
  a manual worker-less container build only.  CI no longer builds them (the tag-push matrix took ~5 h and its failure mode was a cold
  retry).  The fork-branch refresh and the worker image push are both part of tagging a release.
- The `~/llama.cpp` checkout exists to host the block commits and to apply/test the diff set locally.
  Apart from the release-time branch refresh above it is disposable: delete the pre-patched branch and
  re-apply rather than editing history in place.
- Confirm the exact branch name and remote before any push: the branch is always `rdna-boosts`, the
  permitted target is always `git@github.com:stew675/llama.cpp.git` (the personal fork).
- Repeated attempts to push directly to llama.cpp can result in an account ban. When in doubt: don't
  push, ask.

## Layout

| path | what |
|------|------|
| `README.md` | consumer overview + workflow (start here) |
| `ENVIRONMENT.md` | **every environment variable** the delivery adds or repoints — default, and whether it is a kill-switch (default-on, set to disable), an opt-in, a tuning value or a diagnostic. Read it before adding a variable or changing a default |
| `release.json` | **delivery single source of truth** (fork point, canonical tip/tree, block count, per-artifact sha256) — read by `apply-all.sh`, `validate-set.sh` and CI; regenerate with `scripts/make-release.sh`, never hand-edit hashes |
| `MANIFESTS.md` | apply order + the verification contract (release gates, per-block verification, failure handling). Its dated validation history is in `archive/docs/validation-history.md` |
| `BASELINE.md` | fork point, what the patches are, how they are cut, drift policy. Its dated baseline/re-base records are in `archive/docs/baseline-history.md` |
| `TODO.md` | **forward-looking only**: open items, items waiting on someone else, accepted limitations, parked ideas. A closed item is one `WORKLOG.md` entry — never a TODO entry. `#NN` numbers are permanent handles and are never reused |
| `GREEDY-PURITY.md` | the purity rulebook (index + invariants + per-finding claims); dated narratives/evidence are in `archive/docs/GREEDY-PURITY-FINDINGS.md` under the same `§` numbers |
| `patches/` | **the delivery set** (0000-0013: block 00 + blocks 01-13) + `README.md`, the per-block reference (what each block contains, its knobs, its purity notes). The dated amendment notes moved to `archive/docs/patch-notes-history.md` |
| `scripts/` | `apply-all.sh` (the tested apply flow, strict tree check + `git am -3` fallback), `gate-prefill-logits.sh` (the prefill-logit KLD release gate, issue #113), `gate-per-block-build.sh` (a clean `all` build per block commit), `gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh`, `check-gpu-faults.sh` (reads the kernel journal and scans a llama log for **real** GPU faults, filtering the echoed prompt lines — never grep a log for `page fault`/`slab` by hand), `make-patches.sh`, `make-release.sh`, `validate-set.sh` (checksums + fresh-tarball strict apply, runs in CI), `build-containers.sh` (the image build itself), `container-watch.sh` (the off-host release watcher, run on `radiance`), `cleanup-ghcr.py` (GHCR version retention; called by `build-containers.sh --push`), `extract-generated.py` (hashes llama-cli generated text; a naive sed/grep slice does not reproduce the hashes), `check-windows-paths.sh` (fails on a path that Windows cannot check out). **Index: `scripts/README.md`** |
| `rdna-boosts-all.patch` | the entire 12-patch net as ONE patch (fork point only) |
| `benchmarks/` | dated bench records + methodology; **`mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` = the adaptive-MTP baseline gate** (run before shipping any decode/fusion change) and **`prefill-logit-methodology.md` = the prefill-logit KLD gate** (run before shipping any prefill-kernel change or release) |
| `prompts/` | versioned, hash-stable test prompts; sizes/token counts/**sha256** in `prompts/README.md`. A shipped prompt is **never edited in place** (add a new file); a result is only valid against the prompt hash it names |
| `wip/` | **ACTIVE** exploration docs/tools — **NOT part of the delivery**; see the WIP rule. Each campaign is a self-contained handover under its own `README.md` (no `wip/README.md`); the open set is indexed in `wip/CAMPAIGNS.md` |
| `beta/` | **promotion-candidate patches** staged for a beta test — **NOT part of the delivery**. Each candidate is `<name>/` with `README.md` (what/why/status), `BETA-TESTING.md` (the tester's apply + gate checklist) and `<name>.patch` cut against the current `release.json` tree. Nothing here is applied by default: `scripts/apply-all.sh --include-beta` applies `beta/*/*.patch` on top of the verified release tree for a tester. A confirmed or refuted candidate moves to `archive/work/` and is recorded in `WORKLOG.md` |
| `upstream/` | **upstream-PR candidates** (self-contained changes for unadulterated `ggml-org/llama.cpp`), one sub-directory per candidate (`README.md` + `UPSTREAM-PR-<name>.patch`); the index is its `README.md`. None is part of the delivery |
| `archive/docs/` | moved-out historical records (validation/baseline history, the pre-cleanup AGENTS.md) — reference only |
| `archive/work/` | closed experiments and campaigns, preserved for future re-evaluation (mmb/qsa3, moe-expert-cache, issues/PRs, …) — reference only |
| `baseline/*` branches, `block/*` tags | **historical** pre-block-12 checkpoints — do not use for the current delivery |
| `.github/workflows/` | `validate.yml` (per-push delivery validation), `release.yml` (tag-triggered GitHub Release assets) and `docker-ghcr.yml` (manual-only ROCm image fallback); fork point read from `release.json`. **The release container images are built and pushed off-host by the worker watcher (`scripts/container-watch.sh` on `radiance`), not in CI and not on the primary box** — see `CONTAINERS.md` |

## Scope policy — RDNA first, other backends uninjured

This repo is **RDNA/ROCm-specific**: validation, tuning and claims cover the AMD devices the
maintainer runs (gfx1201 = RDNA4, plus validated gfx1151/RDNA3_5 and gfx1100/RDNA3_0). The patch set
is generic llama.cpp, so it must not *break* other backends (NVIDIA/CUDA, MUSA, SYCL, Vulkan, CPU):
keep the shared CMake lists, dispatch tables and predicates mutually consistent even where a change
is unreachable on AMD. **Behaviour and performance on non-AMD backends are explicitly out of scope** —
no tuning, no validation, no waiting on hardware there.

- An AMD-only fix may land without its non-AMD counterpart as long as the non-AMD paths stay
  consistent (no aborts, no uninstantiated pairs) and the difference is documented (see the F1 chooser
  example in `upstream/fa-decode-verify-kernel-family/`).
- New KV-cache types / instances / predicates **are** kept cross-backend consistent — an inconsistent
  set is a crash on whichever backend reaches it (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §20). That is correctness, not
  scope creep.
- "Not validated on NVIDIA" is an acceptable, documented state — never a blocker for an RDNA win.

## Default-on policy — beneficial features are ON; env vars only disable

A feature that improves performance (or correctness) and has passed the relevant QA gates is
**enabled by default**. An environment variable for such a feature exists **only to disable it** — for
A/B testing, bisection or debugging — never to enable it.

**Why:** the maintainer's validation boxes (Strix Halo / gfx1151 in particular) are much slower than
gfx1201, so a gate that silently runs without a beneficial opt-in wastes wall-clock time and reports
slow numbers as if they were the product (the `mmb`/HC16 campaign measured ~835 t/s for a session
when the full set is ~1136 t/s, +36 %).

- When a gate passes, flip the default **in the same change** and turn the old opt-in into an opt-out
  (`FEATURE=0`). Keep reading the env var; just invert the default.
- A feature that is beneficial but not fully gated is a reason to **gate it**, not to leave it off.
  Default-on with the risk documented, then run the gate.
- A kill-switch for a *correctness* risk (a bisect knob, a known-bad-state workaround) may stay
  default-off — the distinction is "on because it helps" vs "off because it is known-risky".
- Before any benchmark, use the full feature set. If you write `FOO=1 <bench>`, ask why the default is
  not already `1`.

## WIP and promotion rules (MANDATORY)

Everything under `wip/` and `archive/work/` (including loose patches/diffs and experiment trees) is
**experimental work, NOT part of the delivery**. Never apply a `wip/`/`archive/work/` item to the fork
or any llama.cpp checkout, and never fold its content into `patches/`, **unless the user explicitly
asks for that specific item**. WIP stays env-gated OFF and excluded from `patches/`; the sanctioned way
out is promotion: collect *validated* wins, give each an env kill-switch, re-validate the
**combination** (individual validations do not carry over), then cut a new block with the maintainer's
go-ahead. Anything also applicable to unadulterated upstream gets a copy under `upstream/`.

**`beta/` is the external-validation holding area, not a third kind of source.**  `scripts/apply-all.sh
--include-beta` is the sanctioned way to *test* one (it applies `beta/*/*.patch` after the release blocks and
reports the resulting tree); nothing in `beta/` is ever picked up without that flag.  A candidate that
cannot sit in `wip/` because it edits a file a block owns, but is not yet validated on the reporter's
platform, goes to `beta/<name>/` (a `README.md`, a `BETA-TESTING.md` and a patch cut against the
current `release.json` tree; nothing in it is applied by `apply-all.sh`).  On confirmation or
refutation it moves to `archive/work/<name>/` and is recorded in `WORKLOG.md` — same no-stub rule as
`wip/`.

**A finished campaign leaves `wip/` — it does not become a stub.**  The moment a campaign is promoted
(folded into `patches/`), closed, or refuted, its record moves to `archive/work/<campaign>/` and the
result is recorded in `WORKLOG.md`, then the `wip/` entry is **deleted** and `wip/CAMPAIGNS.md` is
updated.  Do **not** leave a "MOVED — see archive" placeholder behind: a redirect stub makes `wip/` claim
work is in flight when it is not, which is exactly the state this rule exists to prevent.  Dated records
(`WORKLOG.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `BASELINE.md`, `archive/`) keep the path that was correct when they were
written; when a campaign moves, fix those paths to the new `archive/work/` location rather than keeping a
stub alive to serve them, and treat a `wip/` path in an old record as a historical location.

## Critical facts (do not re-derive)

- **`llama-cli` MUST be run with `--single-turn`** (plus `--no-display-prompt` for scripted output).
  Without it, the interactive chat loop blocks forever. Wrap potentially blocking commands in `timeout`.
- **Apply method:** all 14 blocks with **`git am`**; `scripts/apply-all.sh` is the tested path. Plain
  `git apply` of the concatenated series **silently drops hunks**. Every block is a normal commit.
- **Naming (V2.1):** the current set is **14 blocks, 00-13** (`v14-097cf33d9-r111`).  Every `block NN`
  reference elsewhere in this file that is not one of the V2.1 numbers below is the **pre-V2.1 16-block
  numbering** and is kept as a historical handle.  The V2.1 map: **01** all-reduce, **02** adaptive MTP,
  **03** chunked GDN, **04** BF16 KV, **05** FA band/native/derived, **06** MMB, **07** k-quant,
  **08** fused kernels (fused MoE), **09** host-resident MoE (slab/cache), **10** slab + fusion dispatcher
  + async input ring (infrastructure), **11** qwen4exp (model/QSA/HC/lazy reader), **12** campaign
  remainder, **13** MTP draft vocabulary subset (opt-in).  V2.1 split r109's old block 10 in two: the
  **infrastructure stays 10**, the **qwen4exp architecture is 11** (QSA went with it by decision), so
  every pre-r109 "block 10" note about slab / dispatcher / async-input is still block 10 while a note
  about qwen4exp / QSA / HC / the lazy reader is now block 11.
- **Throughput is NOT a correctness signal.** Verify coherence (same-seed `llama-cli` diff, or
  `archive/work/tools/ar_kernel_unit.cpp`). Decode perf work is validated at **depth-16384**, not
  shallow `llama-bench`. **Never run parallel/background benches.**
- **A fresh-process comparison is only valid with `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`** (set it for that run, do not
  ship it).  On ROCm before the `rocm-libraries` fix (Linux 10.x included — 10.1.0's pin predates it),
  hipBLASLt picks its solution for an untuned FP32 GEMM size **per process start**, so two identical
  commands can produce different logits and a different gen t/s.  This is *not* a defect in this patch set
  (issue #67, external) but it **will** be misread as one: it was the entire residual of the 2026-10 MTP
  determinism hunt (3 logit classes in 18 fresh starts of one gemma4 MTP config; 10/10 with the env set),
  and it made every graph/capture arm look like a cause.  Attribute a per-start difference to the library
  before touching code; **never judge run-to-run determinism on a greedy text hash** — use a logit-level
  probe.  **Keep hipBLASLt enabled in the delivery** (disabling it costs up to -15 % decode; the switch is
  for reproducible runs and bisection only).  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §44,
  `archive/work/fix-gemma-4/evidence/MEASUREMENTS-2026-10-21d.md`.
- **`--lazy-mode off` overrides a mapped load, and `-sm tensor` + `--load-mode none` uses the chunked async ring (r122, block 00).**
  An explicit `off` loads the `TENSOR_READ_LAZY` PLE/engram table into its own host buffer instead of
  serving it from the `--load-mode mmap` mapping (`auto` below 4 GiB stays mapped, so default loads are
  unchanged); `--load-mode mmap --lazy-mode off` is the "fast mapped bulk + resident PLE" combination.
  The stale `ggml_backend_dev_is_meta(dev) -> nullptr` loader bail is gone: the Meta async setter serves a
  mid-row chunk (`write_partial_row`) and the event proxy fans the 4-slot staging ring
  (`LLAMA_LOAD_STAGE_MB`, default 4 MiB) out to the simple devices, so `--load-mode none` under `-sm tensor`
  is ~2x faster (cold Flash-Next load 32.2 -> 13.6 s).  Both are **block 00**; do not reintroduce either
  workaround.  Same-seed greedy text is byte-identical across the load modes on Gemma4-E4B and Flash-Next.
- **A layer-input tap needs the HC-averaged state on qwen4exp (`build_hc_mean`, r121, TODO #94 closed).**
  `qwen4exp` runs `hc` parallel residual streams, so `res_hc` is `hc * n_embd` wide (10240 on Flash-Next)
  while `extract_layer_inp()` demands exactly `n_embd` per row: exporting the wide residual made any
  DFlash2/DSpark head abort at `GGML_ASSERT(row_floats == model.hparams.n_embd)` (llama-context.cpp:3437;
  the F1 device path asserts `t->ne[1] == n_tokens`).  The tap is `graph::build_hc_mean()` (mean over the
  streams, the same 8 lines as deepseek4/glm5-next and the head author's own `hidden_states.mean(dim=-2)`
  capture), **gated on `cparams.embeddings_layer_inp[il]`** so a graph that taps nothing (plain decode, MTP,
  QSA) gains no node — plain decode is byte-identical and the prefill logits are unchanged (KLD −0.000000).
  `target_layers` is `completed + 1` (the capture is a layer *output*), no index shift.  Measured on
  Flash-Next: +40 % code / +91 % recall over plain decode at 3 GPU tensor + `-ncmoe 48`, six
  `plain == draft-dflash` text-identical arm pairs.  Index `n_layer` (the last layer's output) is **not**
  exported — it needs the pre-gather residual; no head taps the final layer.  Record:
  `archive/work/qwen4exp-dflash2/`.
- **A cross-device copy must ask `ggml_cuda_slab_peer_copy_ok()` first (r121).**  The slab's
  peer-access grant is per-device and **best effort**: with three ~29 GiB slabs the driver refuses it for the
  second and third device (the peers have no free VRAM to build a 29 GiB peer mapping), and a
  `hipMemcpyPeerAsync` into an ungranted slab range **faults the GPU** (`HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_FAULT` in
  `__amd_rocclr_copyBuffer`) or returns `invalid argument` — never anything catchable.  The query is
  process-wide for slab destinations: a copy between two fully granted devices still fails while a third
  slab's grants are incomplete.  When it says no, the copy stages through a grow-only pinned buffer
  (`ggml_cuda_peer_copy_staged`, D2H on the src stream, H2D on the dst stream).  Do not add a raw peer copy
  anywhere without the guard; `-sm layer` + `-ncmoe` warm-up aborted on Flash-Next before this (reproduced on
  the r120 base with no drafter).  No env knob.
- **DFlash2 under `-sm tensor` is supported (r106, TODO #78 closed):** the selector's `ggml_top_k` /
  `ggml_get_rows` over the draft logits -- which are the *target's* `output.weight` projection, placed
  vocabulary-split -- are served by a new general collective **`GGML_OP_ALL_GATHER`** (`ggml_all_gather()`)
  that `build_dflash2_selector()` emits when the draft is a >= 2-device tensor split.  On the Meta backend it
  is `MIRRORED`, its own subgraph boundary, and dropped from every per-device child graph; the collective
  copies one row (of every dim above the split axis) at a time because a slice is contiguous in its own copy
  but strided in the full tensor.  **Only a plain axis-0 split is implemented** (anything else aborts by
  design), and there is no env knob: `-sm layer` is the escape hatch.  Mirroring the *drafter* does not work
  (the offending tensor is the target's), and neither does demoting only the drafter to `-sm layer` (a
  layer-split context cannot read the target's Meta-buffer weights).  Two related fixes ship with it: the F1
  `extract_layer_inputs()` device copy cannot express a Meta buffer (host path instead; it aborted for **any**
  DFlash drafter with `dflash.target_layers`), and the **slab narrow-2** pin must yield from the arena when
  the draft's compute buffer exceeds the unmapped VA spare (a tensor-split drafter's is 1280 MiB against the
  estimator's 512 MiB tier; without it `-sm tensor` + draft + `-ncmoe` aborts in `graph_reserve`).  Rule:
  `patches/README.md` (block 12, "Facts that span blocks").
- **The draft context's second scheduler is selected per arch (`sched_alt_for`): `n_outputs` for MTP, the
  batch kind for DFlash/DFlash2 (r120, issue #208).**  MTP's two graphs differ by outputs; a DFlash2
  draft's do not (the lattice is read from `h_nextn`, so `output = !is_dflash2`), so selecting on
  `n_outputs` put the KV injection and the draft step on one scheduler *and* one `gf_res_prev` slot: 0 %
  graph reuse, a rebuild + re-allocate on every verify step (r65-r119).  DFLASH now sends the token batch
  (no `embd`, no `lf_dev_inject`) to the second scheduler and keeps the injection on the main one; every
  other arch keeps `n_outputs`, where the batch kind would *merge* MTP's ingest and step graphs.  Nothing
  else may pick a draft graph slot independently: `get_gf_res_prev()` shares the decision.  Reuse
  0 -> 97.8 %, decode +1.4 % (27B 2 GPU tensor) to +4.0 % (35B-A3B `-ncmoe 40`), text and acceptance
  identical.  Record: `archive/work/dflash2-draft-sched2/`.
- **The expert cache's routing trace is opt-in and is the policy instrument (r110, TODO #61 P1).**
  `MOE_EXPERT_TRACE=<path>` writes every `mul_mat_id`'s raw routing (`scripts/moe-trace-replay.py` scores
  policies against it offline: the shipped F-LRU, static top-f, per-layer quota, window/prefix
  pre-admission).  DECODE records come from the scheduler hook (the ids are already on the host);
  PREFILL records come from the device entry and pay one readback per op (prefill is never captured, so
  that is legal).  An IDENTITY (fully resident) table's decode routing is not traced -- it cannot miss.
  The trace is a *diagnostic* (never default-on) and its absolute hit rate is a model, not the cache:
  judge a policy by its delta.  `MOE_EXPERT_TRACE_MIB` (default 1024) caps the file.
- **Two host-tally gaps are closed and must stay closed (r110, TODO #64).**  (1) The host pool's warm
  order comes from the *device* prefill tally, folded in once at the first decode-band pass
  (`pool_rank_from_prefill_locked`): the eager `prefill_count` path never runs under the staged prefill,
  which left `pool_rerank_from_tally_locked` uncalled and warmed the pool in expert-id order.  (2) A
  fully-resident (identity) table's decode routing is tallied device-side, **sampled**
  (`MOE_EXPERT_HEATMAP_DECODE_SAMPLE`, default 64, 0 off) and weighted by the period.  The heat mirror
  is pre-allocated at sizing: the decode band is a captured graph and a `cudaMalloc` there aborts the
  capture (`operation failed due to a previous error during capture`).
- **The expert cache's *identity fast path* is an all-or-nothing cliff worth ~40 % of decode; r117 makes the
  cache prefer whole-table identity (block 09, TODO #93 closed).**  A table is identity only at **100 % of
  its own slots** ("the decode band reads the arena directly; no per-token routing readback"); one slot short
  and it takes the remap path and pays the readback exactly like a table with no arena.  Each table's arena is
  rounded up to the slab arena unit, so a budget "just enough" in aggregate landed one unit per table short
  and **every** table dropped off: measured (GSQ `-ncmoe 48 -sm tensor`, plain decode) 3 devices
  `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=13800` → arena 40845.1 of 40925.0 MiB, 0/432 identity, **46.7 t/s** vs `15000` →
  432/432, **65.0 t/s**; the same cliff cost the 2-GPU arm 46.3 vs 66.4 t/s at `-c 204800`.  **r117:** when
  ≥ 96 % of the layers can hold their full slot count, those get full residency and the coldest ≤ 4 % are
  dropped to 0 slots (they run through the scheduler's host copy) — +27.6 % on the arm above, bit-identical
  text/acceptance, `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_IDENTITY_PREF=0` restores the uniform placement, and the placement never
  exceeds `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB`.  The cap matters: a dropped layer is not free (1 of 48 = +27.6 %, 6 of 48 =
  −30 %), so an arena that is *percentages* short still pays the readback.  **Any 2-vs-3-device (or decode)
  comparison must still record the arena, the residency % and the count of `identity fast path ON` lines.**
- **Greedy text is a per-device-count reference on the MoE tensor split (r116).**  2 vs 3 GPUs on
  `-ncmoe` + `-sm tensor` produce different text (`PPL 10.8452` vs `10.8623`, 0.16 %, the tensor split's
  own rounding class, `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45) — it is **not** the AR's BF16 wire (`GGML_CUDA_AR_BF16_THRESHOLD=0`
  does not reconcile it).  A **dense** tensor split and *every* `-sm layer` arm are text-identical across
  device counts.  So gate a build change **within** each device count (as r116's own gates did); use
  `-sm layer` when a cross-count text comparison is required; never read a 2-vs-3 text difference as a
  purity defect.
- **The disk tier is bounded by this box's SSD at ~1.8 GB/s, so the cache's currency is `L3 MiB/token`, not
  `h`.**  1 MiB/token of reads that neither VRAM nor the pinned pool holds is ~0.55 ms/token of unavoidable
  stall (~1800 t/s of pure read budget at a 1 MiB/token traffic level, ~100 t/s at 18 MiB/token).  Every
  tiering claim in the records is therefore quoted in MiB/token beside `h` (`scripts/moe-trace-replay.py`
  reports both): r114's band-split heat prior took the long-prompt arm from 48.1 to 17.6 MiB/token, i.e.
  **~26 ms → ~9.5 ms of disk per token**, which is what a decode on that config (46 t/s = 22 ms/token) can
  and cannot afford.  Use the same conversion before proposing a prefetch/eviction policy: the pool-layout
  and topic-shift candidates were all declined because their whole prize was 0.3-0.5 MiB/token.
- **The heat prior is band-split (r114, block 12): the ARENA seed ranks by the decode-only counter, the host
  pool's layout by the combined one.**  `apply_heat_seed_locked` + the heat-ordered layer placement call
  `heat_rank_vec()` (the `heat_dec` vector, falling back to `heat` when a map has no decode mass); the pool's
  `pool_rank_experts_locked` / `pool_rerank_from_heat_locked` keep `heat`, because the pool stages whole
  tables *for a prefill* and there the prefill mass is signal, not noise.  Sidecar format **MHT2** (both
  arrays per table); a **MHT1** file loads with `dec = all` (pre-r114 behaviour), never an error.  Do not
  "simplify" this back to one counter: on a long prompt the prefill outweighs the decode 41x and the arena
  ends up seeded from a nearly uniform distribution (+1.2 to +2.5 pts of `h` and ~3x less disk traffic on
  the measured arms).  `ENVIRONMENT.md` (heat-map note), `patches/README.md` (block 12).
- **Thread sizing is not optional.** `/usr/local/bin/pin_gpu_irqs.sh` puts the GPU IRQs on the top
  `NUM_GPUS` cores (13,14,15 with 3 GPUs); the default `-t` puts the worker pool there and starves the
  GPU (Q4_K_M `-ncmoe 99` tg1024: `-t 16` 19.6 vs `-t 8` 38.9). Size `-t` (or `--cpu-mask` with `-t`
  *inside* the mask) to leave those cores free; one CCD (8) is within 1-2 % of best. r19's block-06
  cap only covers `-ncmoe` offloaded-MoE decode; override with `GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS=N`.
- **Our per-card host link is PCIe 5.0 x4, not x8/x16.** Each R9700 sits behind its own PCIe switch
  (`Navi 10 XL Upstream Port`): the GPU side negotiates **x16 @ 32 GT/s**, but the switch **uplink to the
  host** negotiates **x4 @ 32 GT/s** (`/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.0/current_link_width` = 4; root
  ports `00:01.1` / `00:01.2` are x4 too). That is ~16 GB/s raw per card, **half** of a x8 host and a
  quarter of x16.  Consequences for measurement, measured 2026-10-17 on 35B-A3B Q4_K_M q8_0
  `pp31500`: 1 GPU 3614 t/s, 2 GPU tensor **4482 (+24 %)**, 3 GPU tensor **4347 (-3 % vs 2 GPU)**; the
  same +17 % / +1 % shape is in `archive/work/three-gpu-performance/` (1065 / 1246 / 1258 t/s).  So **multi-GPU
  prefill on this box is link-bound**, and a tensor-split prefill claim from a x8/x16 contributor host
  can only be *under-measured* here, not refuted: report it as "not measurable on our link", not as
  "does not reproduce".  Decode claims do carry over (the per-token AR traffic is tiny): #175's decode
  gain reproduced at 2-GPU tensor while its prefill claim did not.
- **`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` host experts are pinned (`ROCm_Host`) in the DEFAULT mode; `--load-mode mmap` alone
  does NOT change that.** The loader rewrites the `-ncmoe` CPU override for a host `MUL_MAT_ID` weight to
  the layer device's **pinned** host buffer, and the "avoid a host buffer when using mmap" downgrade is
  skipped for it. The pageable `--host-experts mmap` mode and the legacy `LLAMA_MMAP_HOST_EXPERTS` env
  were **removed in r33** (issue #116: a no-XNACK GPU -- gfx1201 reports `XNACK enabled: NO` -- cannot
  read a pageable host master in a kernel, and the pageable fill faults `hipMemcpy2DAsync` on ROCm 7.14).
  `--host-experts` (`llama_model_params.host_experts_mode`) selects **`pinned`** (default),
  **`pool`** (r35/r111) or `mmap` (logs "unsupported" and falls back to pinned).  Pinned is deliberate --
  the per-ubatch op-offload H2D upload and the expert-cache fill both read this master in place, and under
  `-sm tensor` a pageable master would land in the non-`is_host` `CPU_REPACK` (no device access, cache
  inert).  Cost of the default: the host expert set is non-swappable RAM (Q4_K_M 35B-A3B `-ncmoe 40`,
  cache off: `ROCm_Host` 18662 MiB; peak RSS ~41.7 GB).  `--lazy-mode` governs the mmap *reader*, not
  this. `ENVIRONMENT.md` §§1.2.1/4; `patches/README.md` (blocks 09/12).
- **`--host-experts pool` (r111) has NO pinned master: the master IS the read-only model mapping, and
  every GPU read of a pooled host expert goes through pinned memory.**  The tensors live in the model
  mapping (host buft `ROCm_HostMap`, device-carrying, r111, **block 12**) and are never read by a device
  copy or a kernel; the L2 tier is the bounded pool (`MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB`/`FRAC`, default **80 %** of the
  host expert bytes since r112, *per tensor*, process-wide, capped at **`MOE_HOST_POOL_RAM_PCT` = 85 %** of
  `MemAvailable` since r114) and the L3 tier is the GGUF, read with O_DIRECT **only when the page cache
  cannot hold the set** (`MOE_HOST_POOL_DIO` is **`auto`** since r114: decided once at the first pool build
  from `MemAvailable` vs `planned pool + host expert set`; `0`/`1` still force either arm).  The
  mode is only for the case where the set does **not** fit in RAM: when it fits, `pinned` is faster on every
  axis.  80 % is the measured knee (90 % was slower and swapped).  The invariants:
  (1) a pooled table must never be served by a **pageable** `cudaMemcpyAsync` -- ROCm stages a pageable
  upload through a shared internal bounce and back-to-back copies tear (this is what made the first cut
  nondeterministic; `moe_cache_upload_pageable`, the staging bounce and the `stage_gather` host-gather
  shape all exist for it); (2) the cold-UVA serve and the device gather require a *pinned* master and
  stand down (`host_dev == nullptr`) -- a miss becomes a pool fill; (3) any new reader of a host expert
  master must go through `expert_host_src` (pool slot / per-table pinned bounce) or be added to
  `moe_cache_upload_pageable`; (4) the mode needs a **mapped** load (`--load-mode none/dio` keeps the
  pinned master and warns).  Measured: `RssShmem` 18.6 GiB -> 6.8 GiB on 35B-A3B `-ncmoe 40`, and a
  12 GiB or 8 GiB cgroup that OOM-kills the `pinned` arm runs this one at ~93 t/s.  Cost: one extra host
  memcpy per staged byte on the host-expert prefill path (single-ubatch `pp512` on 2-GPU tensor -34 %),
  which is why the staging copy itself must stay batched (`MOE_HOST_POOL_STAGE_BATCH`, r114).  Record:
  `archive/work/host-expert-master-drop/`.
- **The host pool is a LAYOUT, not a churning cache (r113, block 12; TODO #87's disk-I/O half).**  The
  pool's **content** is what decides the disk traffic — measured offline on a real trace: pool ranked by
  expert id = 3571 MiB of L3 reads over 451 decode tokens, ranked by the **persisted heat prior** as the
  arena's *complement* = 237 MiB, oracle = 237 MiB — while **every** eviction/hand-over policy lands within
  0-246 MiB of the others.  So: (1) `pool_rank_experts_locked` / `pool_rerank_from_heat_locked` lay the pool
  out as the arena's complement, in bulk, at sizing and at the first decode-band pass (the old flat
  prompt-tally re-rank is gone — a prefill routes every expert, so its tally cannot rank); (2) the **demand
  path never evicts and never copies the arena victim into the pool** (`pool_peek_locked` /
  `pool_fill_empty_locked`; the background worker and `MOE_HOST_POOL_BGFETCH` are gone) — do not reintroduce
  one: the literal swap cost **2x decode** for 0 MiB of L3; (3) the whole-table prefill staging reads the
  pool and fills empty slots (it used to bypass it and re-read the whole host set per ubatch); (4)
  `MOE_HOST_POOL_RAM_PCT` (default **85** since r114) caps the whole pinned pool at that % of `MemAvailable` — `FRAC`
  is a percentage of the model's host expert set, not of RAM, and an oversized pool fails each table's
  `cudaHostAlloc` *silently*.  Field config (70K prompt, 128-token decode, 2x R9700): pool hit 0.80 -> 0.92,
  evictions 4600 -> 0, prefill 39 -> 287 t/s (`DIO=1`) / 581 -> 733 t/s (`DIO=0`), decode 6.3 -> 23.1 /
  30.6 -> 53.7, against `pinned` 836 / 57.5.  The tool that decided it (`scripts/moe-trace-replay.py
  --pool-frac`, two-tier, reads a real `.moe-heatmap`): use it before proposing another pool policy.  Record:
  `archive/work/host-pool-layout/`.
- **POOL mode: the fill mode is automatic and the staging is one launch (r114, block 12, TODO #87).**
  `MOE_HOST_POOL_DIO` = `auto` (decided once at the first pool build from `MemAvailable` vs `planned pool +
  host expert set`: buffered when the set fits beside the pool, O_DIRECT when it does not; `0`/`1` force),
  and `moe_cache_stage_kernel` fills **both** tiers (arena slot / pool slot) for a pool-backed table, so a
  prefill staging is one launch instead of one `cudaMemcpyAsync` per expert.  Measured (2x R9700, 35B-A3B
  Q4_K_M `-ncmoe 40 --host-experts pool`, 70K prompt, `-ub 2048`): prefill **2103 t/s** vs **1564** with
  `MOE_HOST_POOL_STAGE_BATCH=0` (+34 %), decode 46.4; forced `DIO=1` 2088/**22.7**; `pinned` 2099/49.3.
  Text is byte-identical across every arm and `MOE_HOST_POOL_VERIFY=1` is clean.  **Long-session adaptation
  was measured and declined**: the oracle-layout ceiling is 7.45 MiB/token of L3 vs 8.05 for a
  previous-topic layout (~6 % per topic shift), and every churning policy costs several times that.
  Record: `archive/work/host-pool-swap-and-prefill/`.
- **MTP gates must be long and reasoning-pinned.** Use `-n 3000` (`-n 2000` floor), `--reasoning on`
  for R and `--reasoning off` for P/C/K. Short runs are a correctness smoke test only. Rule 0 in
  `benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md`.
- **Prefill-logit purity is a release gate (issue #113).** Same-seed coherence and MTP are blind to a
  uniform prefill shift. Run `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh` before shipping any change to a prefill
  kernel (GDN/SSM chunked, FA, MMQ/MMVF/MMB, MoE prefill) or a default-on approximate path: it compares
  against a recorded known-good base and requires mean KLD <= 0.005 and same-top-p >= 98 %. The r29
  example: the default-on BF16 chunked GDN measured 0.032 / 93.6 % and was flipped off.  A
  **kernel-family switch** (a tile→WMMA head cap) uses `--family-switch` instead: it refuses a point
  outside the gate's calibrated domain (base PPL > 10; at a point the model finds hard even a benign
  same-kernel ubatch change measures 0.105 / 85 %) and always prints a same-kernel control, so the
  absolute limits stay the criterion without an insensitive point waving a bad change through.
  Protocol: `benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`, `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §46.
- **Mixed K/V cache types are HARD-REJECTED** at context creation (`params.type_k != params.type_v`);
  every mixed pair measured 1.7-3.6x slower and never smaller. Pass matching `-ctk`/`-ctv`.
- **The MTP draft-vocabulary trim is opt-in and draft-only (block 13, r107).**  `--spec-draft-mtp-vocab N`
  copies the LM-head rows for ids `< N` (+ control/user ids) into the draft context, scores the draft over them
  and scatters into a full-vocab row of `-inf`; the target still verifies the full vocabulary, so the trim can
  only lose proposals.  `0` = off = today's code path.  **N is payload-specific** (98304 on Qwen3.8-27B Q8_0,
  64000 is the reporter's gfx1151 value and a *loss* on our 27B, gemma4's only lossless cut is 245760/262144 =
  a no-op), it costs `N/n_vocab` of the head in VRAM (510 MiB at 98304, per device under `-sm tensor`) and it
  is **not** in the `--fit` estimate.  Gate purity at **`n_max <= 7`** (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §48: the trim moves
  acceptance, which moves the adaptive controller's depth, which moves the verify widths); the shipped
  recommendation is `--spec-draft-n-max 7 --spec-draft-mtp-vocab 98304` (leave `--spec-draft-n-start` at its
  default 3 — it is the *initial* depth, not a ceiling).  **Check the device count before enabling it:** the
  subset head is *mirrored* per device under `-sm tensor` while the untrimmed head is *split*, so it pays only
  when **`N * n_devices < n_vocab`** — on the 27B 98304 is +1.4 % at 2 GPU (share 124160) and **-2.2 % at
  3 GPU** (share 82773, the server shape), and no N pays at 3 GPU.  The `ggml` half is the
  `ggml-backend-meta` row-range read that makes a vocabulary-split LM head readable piecewise.

- **`--spec-draft-n-max` is capped at 15** (the recurrent snapshot bound); purity is promised only to
  **7** (the kernel-family switch at 8 rows). `LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP=0` escapes the clamp.
- **The mmvq band-uniform knobs are a purity requirement *and* a perf trap.** `nwarps` and the vec_dot
  VDR participate in the mmvq K-split order, so one value must hold across the whole band (`W=1..8`)
  and must be tuned at the **verify widths**. RDNA4 dense `nwarps=1`; dense VDR=2, MoE-expert VDR=4.
  The **pinned fusion ops (GDN/SSM, shared-expert, gate fusions) MUST keep plain `calc_nwarps`** — they
  are single-token reduction-order anchors. Run the stock-relative
  `llama-batched-bench -npl 1,4,8` gate (`mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` rule 5) before any decode/mmvq
  change. `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §§19/24/25.
- **The adaptive-MTP controller is the tuned bucketed one** (`v16-d1d3c3396-r2`): `delta = n_accepted -
  depth`, `climb_budget(d) = 20 + 6*(d-1)`, `drop_pressure(d) = max(60, 10*d)`, cold start
  `max(floor, cap-3)`, `--spec-draft-n-start N`. Judge any change on the four axes **and** the
  phase-switching `prompts/code-reasoning-mixed.txt`. Records:
  `benchmarks/2026-09-15-adaptive-mtp-tuning.md`, `archive/work/adaptive-mtp-ceiling-scaling/`.
- **FA instantiation discipline:** a FA kernel's KV *type* axis must be instantiated in the generated
  `template-instances/*.cu` files, never left implicitly in the dispatch TU (it gates the build).
  Check with `nm -C <obj> | grep -c <case>`: the dispatch TU shows `U`, the instance TUs `T`/`W`.
  Detail: `archive/work/build-time-regression/`.
- **The host-resident-expert device gather's head pad must match the host path**
  (`min(expert_size, 512)`; **64 is IQ4_NL-only**), keyed on `(input_cpy buffer, expert_bytes)`. Run
  `scripts/gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh` before changing `moe_cache_gather_host` or the head zero.
  Needs no `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB`.
- **A compute buffer that cannot grow must never abort; the MoE arena is what yields (r20).**
  `GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT` (default **10**, `0` disables) pads each COMPUTE buffer allocation so a
  runtime graph's slightly larger layout (+3.3 % measured) does not force a free-then-allocate-larger
  **contiguous** block -- that needs a block *bigger than the one just released*, so free VRAM elsewhere
  (including a smaller arena) does not substitute. The slack is an opt-in buffer-type capability
  (`get_compute_margin_pct`), set only by the RDNA/ROCm path and aggregated (min) by the meta buffer type,
  so no other backend's allocation sizes change. `ggml_cuda_device_malloc` is the single allocation choke
  point: on OOM it frees the largest arena table, then the whole arena, and retries; a failed ramp leaves
  the cache disabled rather than aborting. Keep the two together. Related invariant: a partially-failed
  cache **falls back wholesale** (the fusion guard and `moe_cache_take_over` must agree), and no arena may
  be freed while a kernel that carries its address in its launch parameters is in flight
  (`moe_cache_sync_devices_locked`). `GREEDY-PURITY.md`/`archive/work/moe-cache-autosize/ARENA-UB-TENSION.md`
  §13-§14.
- **The movable-boundary slab is MoE-only and must stay that way (r37).** `ggml_cuda_slab_enabled()`
  returns `env_on && g_slab_armed`; `g_slab_armed` is set **only** by the MoE preflight
  (`ggml_backend_cuda_device_moe_cache_preflight`), which `llama_model_moe_cache_preflight` calls only for
  models with a non-empty `model->moe_host_expert_bytes` (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` > 0).  The slab exists to let the
  work region and the expert-cache arena coexist; with no arena it parks nearly all free VRAM in an unused
  region (measured ~18 GiB/GPU on a dense 27B).  The **compute chunk** (`GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_CHUNK_MIB`) is
  slab-motivated and is gated on the same condition.  Do **not** re-enable either for dense models; the
  dense regression is issues #118 (slab before the weights OOMs a 48 GiB card under `--mmproj`) and #120
  (the chunk cost a dense config +739 MiB and tipped it into shared memory).  The percentage margin
  (`GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT`) is deliberately *not* gated (kept for dense).
- **An upload that writes a scheduler-managed buffer goes on the main stream (r62, block 10).**  The
  scheduler's `wait_before_overwrite()` (a wait on the previous split's event) guards the graph
  allocator's reuse of a split-input buffer and is enqueued on the **main** stream.  The compact
  splice-gather's 1-D H2D ran on `cuda_ctx->copy_stream()` and only ordered the *consumer*, so it could
  overwrite the buffer while the previous split still read it -- garbage/NaN for `-sm tensor` + `-ncmoe`
  on the below-gate path (35B-A3B, gemma4, Flash-Next GSQ).  A side stream is only safe with an explicit
  wait on the main stream recorded *before* this upload; the gather has no such need (it must wait for
  the reused-buffer read anyway).
- **The async graph-input ring (`GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT`) is opt-in and a run is not start-to-start
  deterministic when the consumer is a captured HIP graph** (r69; re-characterised 2026-10-19).  `-ub 8`
  and `-ub 1` self-KLD comparisons diverge with `n_seq = 1`; `-ub 512` and `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1`
  are bit-identical.  **The cause is NOT the ring**: the uploads verify byte-correct at the graph's first
  read, HIP's wait-before-replay / event-after-replay ordering is correct, and consecutive graphs do not
  overlap — so the async path is the *trigger* (it removes the per-copy host block), not the defect.
  **FIXED in r90 (TODO #73 closed)**: the defect was `ggml_backend_cuda_set_tensor_async` /
  `_set_tensor_2d_async`, which issued a pinned-source `cudaMemcpyAsync` **straight from the caller's live
  host pointer** while the scheduler uses that path for a host-resident split input -- a CPU split's
  output that the next ubatch rewrites in place -- so with the host running ahead the copy could read the
  next ubatch's bytes (a rare single-graph corruption that propagated to the end of the chunk).  Both now
  snapshot through the pinned upload ring, unconditionally, and the ring's wait/done guard is
  unconditional; `GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT` is **default-on** (`=0` disables) and the batched uploads
  (`GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT_BATCH`, r89/PR #182) stay default-on inside it.  Self-KLD control 91.0-95.1 %
  -> 99.967-100.000 %; decode +9.3 % (35B-A3B 2 GPU tensor tg400) / +5.2 % (27B MTP n3 end-to-end).
  Evidence: `archive/work/async-input-graph-ordering/` (`RESOLUTION.md`, `FINDINGS-2026-10-19b.md`).
- **The batched state save and restore share one pinned `state_stage` per context (r96/r119, PRs #189/#209).**
  `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC` covers saves, `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC_READ` (default on) covers restores, and
  `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC_MAX_MIB` bounds both.  Saves and restores on one context must not run concurrently.
  The restore is a multi-device win (2 GPU `-sm tensor`: 35B-A3B 49 -> 40 ms, Flash-Next 89 -> 75 ms);
  one GPU pays about 2 ms for the extra staging copy, so do not read the single-GPU number as a defect.
- **The op-offload H2D staging ring (V2.0 block 09; old block 06, r12) has three invariants:** (1) prefill is never
  CUDA-graph captured, so a redirected split input that reaches a copy path aborts (tripwire asserts
  this); (2) the width gate is floored at **64 tokens**; (3) the arena lives **outside** the
  compute-graph reserve, so a failed allocation disables staging instead of aborting, and a partially
  staged ubatch is never allowed. Under `-sm tensor` the meta backend owns one ring per device and
  `MIRRORED` tensors must serve arbitrary byte ranges. The expert weights themselves are **split** per
  device, not mirrored (`GGML_META_SPLIT_COPY=1`; each cache table holds `expert_bytes = host_bytes/2`,
  measured 2026-10-07), so any `-sm tensor -ncmoe` vs `-sm layer` gap is the per-op upload/pruning
  machinery, not weight duplication. (`TODO.md` #44 was closed on that finding; see
  `archive/work/expert-cache-split/`.)
- **Cross-device split inputs (V2.0 block 09; old block 06, r12):** a device-to-device input copy runs on the SOURCE
  backend's stream, so `wait_before_overwrite` (which only orders the destination stream) is not
  enough; the block records a fresh event on the destination backend and makes the source wait on it
  before the copy. Without it, `-sm layer` on 2 GPUs with host experts (`--n-cpu-moe` >= 29) can
  overwrite an earlier split's output before its outbound copy reads it (garbage prefill);
  `GGML_SCHED_EVENTS=0` is the old workaround. Issue #103, contributor PR #104,
  `archive/work/2gpu-sched-fixes/VERIFICATION.md`.
- **The QSA op has a CPU oracle** (`test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_QSA`, 18/18 minimum). The `W=1..8`
  matrix is **blind to a width-uniform corruption**, and MTP acceptance is not a quality signal when
  draft and target share the defect; use the perplexity ratio vs the dense masked path
  (`LLAMA_QSA_SPARSE_FA=0`). A fused op with several heads sharing a staging buffer must keep the block
  homogeneous in every index the staging reads (QSA: the K/V head). `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §21.
- **Block 03 (GDN; old block 02):** the chunked prefill is K-independent with threshold `max(K>16?K:16, n_rs_batch)`,
  `n_rs_batch = common_speculative_n_max()+1`; `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` forces the sequential kernel
  (correct, bit-identical, slow). The pure `none == draft-mtp` range is `n_max <= 7`.
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §27, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-09-12.
- **The rollback bound is enforced by `n_rs_batch`, not observed — do not re-derive it.**  `common`
  sets `cparams.n_rs_batch = common_speculative_n_max() + 1` over **every** speculator type (draft
  simple/mtp/adaptive/eagle3/dflash/dspark *and* ngram simple/map/mod/cache, so ngram-mod's default
  n_max 64 gives 65), `llama_context` floors it at `n_rs_seq + 1`, and `delta-net-base` passes it as
  GDN op param 1.  The op's threshold is floored at it, so a **speculative verify batch can never take
  the chunked path** and always restores snapshots it wrote (r91; the campaign's "ngram is an exposure"
  claim was wrong).  The r91 sequential tail (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_TAIL`, block 10) then covers the remaining
  source of a partial rollback: a **non-speculator** rewind into a prefill batch (server cancel /
  `--cache-reuse`).  The per-sequence tracker is block 03's (`prepare()` folds in every ubatch;
  `LLAMA_RS_ROLLBACK_DEBUG=1` shows `RSPREP`/`RSROLL`).  Record + probe:
  `archive/work/rs-rollback-boundary/`.
- **Test baselines are per box *and* per model: never compare to a number in this file.**  E.g.
  `test-recurrent-state-depth` on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q3_K_M: **130** failures on gfx1201, **153** on
  gfx1151; the gate is that the per-arm FAIL/PASS set is unchanged, not that the count is zero.  Run it
  (and any other GPU test) **alone** — two GPU jobs at once changes the arena/band layout and invents
  failures.
- **Block 01 (all-reduce; old block 12):** the `GGML_CUDA_AR_PROFILE` device-list init fix; on the first NCCL runtime failure the
  comm layer warns once, disables NCCL and re-routes to the internal pipeline/butterfly.
  `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=nccl` is **NOT bit-identical** under `-sm tensor` (the internal AR BF16-round-trips).
- **Block 08 MTP regression fixes (old block 13):** the dense K-split kernel for verify batches, and the
  rms_norm->mmvq Q8_1 fold gated to single-token MMID + plain `MUL_MAT`. **Purity ranks above raw
  non-MTP throughput.** `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §19.
- **MoE decode/verify is byte-identical by default:** the fused shared-expert band serves
  `1 <= nt <= 8` with `nwarps` pinned; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1` is the A/B kill-switch.
- **The r25 tensor-split fold (PR #106 minus its patch 0002) has three invariants to keep together:** a
  retired **Q8_1 arena must outlive captured graphs** (`GGML_CUDA_Q8_1_ARENA_FREE_OLD=1` restores the
  `quantize_q8_1` page fault); a graph is **recaptured when the pool / FA-staging / H2D-ring memory it
  captured is freed** (`GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_MEM_GEN=0` disables); and the **meta split-state cache keeps 8
  versions with compact entries** (`GGML_META_SS_VERIFY=1` verifies hits).  **PR #106 patch 0002 (the
  data-pointer graph key) is deliberately NOT in the delivery**: on the r22+ movable-boundary slab the
  per-device allocations vary between otherwise-identical calls, so the extra key invalidates warm graphs
  and recaptures (measured -19 % `-sm tensor` MTP at `--spec-draft-p-min 0.5`, with identical text and
  acceptance).  Re-cut it against the slab before revisiting.  `TODO.md` #46, `WORKLOG.md` 2026-10-07 (r25).
- **A captured graph is only valid while the slab work region's layout is unchanged.**  The work region is a
  movable boundary: at the post-prefill drop the narrow re-reserve shrinks it and the bytes above the new
  boundary go back to the MoE arena.  A captured CUDA/HIP graph bakes the work-region addresses into its
  executable graph, so the shrink **must** bump `ggml_cuda_graph_mem_freed(device)` (block 10,
  `ggml_cuda_slab_work_alloc`) — otherwise a later replay reads released memory.  Issue #187: a 4-stream MTP
  decode replayed a graph whose KV `set_rows` source indices pointed into the released wide region and
  faulted with `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION`; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1` hid it.  Every
  shrink path taken at a drop still needs this; add it wherever a new one is introduced.
- **Under `-sm tensor` the HIP graph cache must be keyed on a *stable* identity — the Meta backend
  re-creates its per-device simple tensors on every rebuild (r115, TODO #51).**  `ggml_cuda_graph_get_key()`
  is `{ first node's `data` pointer, n_tokens }` and must stay that way (`GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_KEY_DATA=0`
  restores the old object-address key, A/B only).  With the object address the cache never warmed: 3954
  keys / 1206 captures / 484 ms of `hipGraphInstantiate` per 300-token decode at 3 devices vs 67 keys / 9 ms
  with `-sm layer` — the user-visible 200-450 ms 3-GPU stutter, and the reason 3 GPUs decoded slower than 2.
  Keyed on `data`: 144 keys / 15 ms and **+41 %** at 3 devices (+6 % at 2, unchanged at 1), identical text
  and acceptance.  Any new *fingerprint* added to the key (an object address, a generation counter, a
  per-allocation pointer) re-introduces the churn if it moves across a rebuild — the r25 PR #106-0002
  data-fingerprint key that was dropped for the slab is the same trap from the other direction.
  Record: `archive/work/graph-key-churn/`.
- **There is NO periodic per-device decode stall left after r115 (TODO #89 closed, 2026-10-22).  Do not
  re-chase it.**  The ~300 ms that `CUDAGC_SLOW` still reports at 3 devices is a **one-time lazy HIP
  code-object load per (module, device)** (~55 ms of it is the `mul_mat_q` object, which holds mmq *and*
  mmvq), paid inside `common_init_from_params`'s existing 2-token warm-up for the decode families and
  inside the first real prefill for the prefill-only ones.  The count is identical at 300, 1000 and 1500
  generated tokens — it does not scale with tokens, only with device count, and `--no-warmup` moves the
  same cost onto the user's first step (which is what the warm-up exists to prevent).  A first use
  inflates the whole window (`RMS_NORM` 4.7 ms right after the FA load) because further enqueues block
  behind the load; `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_GRAPHS=1` changes nothing.  `CUDAGC_SLOW`'s 5 ms threshold is per
  child-graph launch and is **not** device-count normalised, so on 1 GPU ordinary 4 000-node steps are
  reported — judge per node (~1-2 us) or by `FIRSTUSE`.  Also measured there: `hipFuncGetAttributes` in
  these runs is **librccl** (NCCL init), not ours.  Tooling (probe extension + an `LD_PRELOAD` HIP
  call-site interposer): `archive/work/decode-warmup-stall/`.
- **A `-sm tensor` model load uploads tensors through a pinned staging buffer, one alloc/free per
  tensor** (`ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_set_tensor_2d`, 678 pairs = 2.2 s + 1.1 s of a ~10.7 s load on a 27B
  Q8_0 at 3 devices).  This is *load* time, not decode.  Since **r116** the staging buffer is grow-only
  per device (~5 allocations, 12.7 s -> 9.5 s, block 08; `GGML_CUDA_STAGE_PIN=0` is the kill switch).
- **The deepseek4/glm5-next `DSV4_HC_POST` arm is split-mode dependent (r97).**  `cparams.fused_dsv4_hc_post`
  is the fused **op** whenever a Meta (tensor-split) device is in play and the primitive
  `hc_combine_norm` chain on one device.  The chain is faster on one device (+0.9..+1.8 % prefill,
  gfx1151) but is **not correct across a tensor split**: `test-llama-archs -a deepseek4` on 3x gfx1201
  read NMSE 1.74e-01 through the chain vs 6.5e-06 through the op.  Do not make the chain unconditional
  again without fixing its split-state handling; `LLAMA_FUSED_DSV4_HC_POST` forces either arm.
- **A host buft with no device is never accounted as host experts (r97).**  `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type()`
  has `.device = NULL` upstream; the account map, the slab, the H2D ring and the expert cache all need a
  **pinned** master read in place by a device kernel, so a pageable placement (CPU-only, or
  `--override-tensor exps=CPU`) is left to the upstream `llama_moe_cache` engine.  Keying a null device
  aborted in `ggml_backend_dev_memory()`; keying the layer's device reserves a ring/arena the path cannot
  use.  `patches/README.md` (block 09).
- **Dense greedy purity:** `plain == draft-mtp` greedy text is kept for **f16/bf16/q8_0**; the coarse
  quants (q4_0/q4_1/q5_0/q5_1/iq4_nl) are relaxed to the **logits level** (argmax preserved, top-2
  margin >= 2.2). The FA chooser is TILE across the whole band. Re-run the 8-type x 5-length grid when
  a single-token-tuned kernel changes. `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §36.
- **The high-power pin regressed** (`~/bin/high-power`: tg -5-7 %, pp -15-18 % on RCCL/hybrid paths).
  Servers run **unpinned**, 3-GPU (`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2`), hybrid default.
- **The set applies whitespace-clean** (`apply-all.sh`, no git whitespace warnings).

## Common tasks

### Apply the set to a fresh llama.cpp checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
git checkout <release.json.base>
bash <this-repo>/scripts/apply-all.sh .     # creates branch rdna-boosts, 14 commits

# with the beta candidates on top (NOT the release tree; for a beta test only)
bash <this-repo>/scripts/apply-all.sh --include-beta .   # 14 blocks + beta/*/*.patch (15 commits)
```

### Verify (the coherence gate — mandatory after any change)

Local models live under `/llm/models/` (e.g. `Qwen3.5/4B/Q8_0/...`, `Qwen3.8/27B/Q4_K_XL/...`,
`Qwen3.6/35B-A3B/Q8_0/...`, the Gemma4 tree). Paths in older docs are host-specific; resolve them
against `/llm/models/`.

```bash
HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 ./build/bin/llama-cli -m /llm/models/Qwen3.5/4B/Q8_0/Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0.gguf \
  -ngl 99 -sm tensor -mg 0 -p "The capital of France is" -n 20 \
  --seed 42 --temp 0 --no-display-prompt --single-turn
```

Diff against a known-good build: same-seed output must be IDENTICAL. `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=nccl` is not
a bit-identical reference under `-sm tensor` (see Block 01 above); treat it as a smoke comparison.

The coherence gate is a decode/greedy check and is **blind to a uniform prefill-logit shift**. For any
change to a prefill kernel (GDN/SSM, FA, MMQ/MMVF/MMB, MoE prefill) or a default-on approximate path,
run the **prefill-logit gate** as well:

```bash
./scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh          # compare the current build against the known-good base
./scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh --record # (re)record the base from a known-good build
./scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh --ab "GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16=0"  # exact-fallback A/B
```

It requires mean KLD <= 0.005 and same-top-p >= 98 %. Issue #113 (the lossy default-on BF16 chunked
GDN) passed the coherence gate and was only visible to this one; protocol in
`benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`.

### Regenerate the patches (after fork changes)

`scripts/make-patches.sh` (defaults read from `release.json`) `git format-patch --start-number 0`s the
block commits (block 00 keeps prefix `0000`; `git diff <base>..<tip>` yields `rdna-boosts-all.patch`).
Always regenerate from a canonical fork rebuilt at `release.json.base` via `scripts/apply-all.sh`:
the working `~/llama.cpp` branch is not the canonical chain and a raw range there can export upstream
commits. Then re-verify the clean-apply simulation (fresh worktree, apply, build, coherence, and
`scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh`).

### Build the fork

```bash
cd ~/llama.cpp && ~/bin/build-llama-rocm          # default BUILD_DIR=build-rocm, ROCm 10.1.0
# fast loop: cmake --build build-rocm --target llama-cli llama-bench -j 16
# runtime libs: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm-10.1.0-gfx120X/lib
```

**Keep the ccache large enough for a per-block build or it thrashes.**  The tool's default
`max_size = 5 GiB` is far too small once one source tree carries several `GGML_CUDA_FA_*` instantiation
sets: `scripts/gate-per-block-build.sh` then misses on nearly every FA translation unit and evicts the
entries the next block needs (measured 2026-10-21: block 05 went from ~45 min at 5 GiB to ~7 min after
`ccache --max-size=30G`).  Set it once per box.

**`~/bin/build-llama-rocm` (ROCm 10.1.0, `/opt/rocm-10.1.0-gfx120X`) is the canonical build tree.**
`~/bin/build-llama-rocm-714` is the older ROCm 7.14 tree (its own `BUILD_DIR`, `build-rocm-714`); it is
still valid for a 7.14-specific check, but do not present it as the default. **Do not pass
`EXTRA_CMAKE_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS="`** (or any `-DCMAKE_HIP_FLAGS` override): both scripts pass a
joined `-isystem<rocm>/include` there and abort the configure if the flag does not reach the HIP compile
line (the include-order guard). That guard exists because the failure is otherwise silent -- HIP headers
resolve from Fedora's ROCm 7.1 in `/usr/include`, and the resulting binary still produces identical
greedy text on 7.14. The old CMake >= 4.3 problem (a bare `-mllvm` swallowing the injected
`--cuda-host-only`) is already handled by not passing `-mllvm` at all. **ccache is on by default** when
present (the build dir is reused incrementally unless you pass `clean`; ccache makes even a wiped
rebuild of unchanged sources a cache hit).

The FA instances are deliberately force-inlined — do **not** outline the FA loader
(measured: a universal 1.5-2.5 % prefill loss). This is the sanctioned answer to "the build is slow";
detail in `archive/work/build-time-regression/`.

### Build the release container images (worker by default; local only for smoke)

The ROCm container images are built and pushed **off-host** by the worker watcher
(`scripts/container-watch.sh` on `radiance`), which polls the delivery repo for a new `v12-*` tag and
runs `scripts/build-containers.sh --rocm "7.14.1 10.1" --push --prune` on that box.  This keeps the
primary box free for benchmarks, and a tag-push CI build is not used either (~5 h for two ROCm lines,
and a failed/timed-out run wrote no registry cache so every retry was cold).  **After `git push` of
the tag, nothing else is needed: the worker picks it up within 10 minutes.**  The commands below are
for the worker's one-time setup, or for a smoke build on the primary box; **do not run the full
`--rocm "7.14.1 10.1" --push` on the primary box during a release.**  The fast CI workflows stay:
`validate.yml` (per-push patch validation) and `release.yml` (the tag-triggered GitHub Release
carrying `rdna-boosts-all.patch`, `patches.tar.gz`, `release.json` and `SHA256SUMS`).

**Scope: this is the container image build only.**  The normal local source build used for testing,
benchmarking and the release gates (`~/bin/build-llama-rocm`, `build-pr`/`build-r69`/..., plus the
coherence, MTP and prefill-logit runs) is unaffected and is still done on the primary box.  "Do not run
the full build locally" means the `podman` image build below, not `cmake --build`.

**Worker (`radiance`) one-time setup** (full detail in `CONTAINERS.md`):

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"     # cron + rootless podman survive logout/reboot
gh auth login -h github.com                 # classic PAT needs write:packages + delete:packages
install -m 755 <repo>/scripts/container-watch.sh ~/bin/rdna-container-watch.sh
( crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo '*/10 * * * * $HOME/bin/rdna-container-watch.sh >> $HOME/.cache/rdna-containers/watch.log 2>&1' ) | crontab -
```

**Primary box: manual container build (only if not using the worker) or a fast smoke:**

```bash
./scripts/build-containers.sh --prepare-only               # reconstruct + verify the release tree
./scripts/build-containers.sh --rocm "7.14.1 10.1" --push --prune   # full build; prefer the worker
./scripts/build-containers.sh --rocm 10.1 --arch gfx1201 --targets server   # fast smoke, no push
```

`scripts/build-containers.sh` reads `release.json`, materialises the canonical patched tree
(`release.json.tip`, asserting `tree`) into `$HOME/llama-src`, writes the build-context
`.dockerignore` (from `.devops/dockerignore`), builds `full`/`light`/`server` per ROCm line with the
same build args the CI matrix used, applies the same registry tags (`rocm-<v>`,
`server-/light-/full-rocm-<v>`, the immutable `-<base>` variants and `latest` on 10.1) and (`--push`)
pushes to `ghcr.io/stew675/llama-cpp-rdna-boosts`.  `docker-ghcr.yml` remains only as a manual
`workflow_dispatch` fallback.

**ccache is on.**  `.devops/rdna-rocm.Dockerfile` installs the upstream static ccache **4.12.3** (the
version the host validates, not Ubuntu's older package), sets `CCACHE_DIR=/root/.ccache` and adds
`-DCMAKE_{HIP,C,CXX}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache` (mirroring `~/bin/build-llama-rocm`), with
`/root/.ccache` as a build cache-mount — never an image layer, so the published images are unchanged.
Measured single-arch: cold compile 10m01s → cache-warm rebuild 1m28s (835/836 direct hits).  A release
whose sources mostly match the previous one recompiles only the delta.

**Prune only the built images, never the base images.**  `--push --prune` publishes and then removes the
just-built `ghcr.io/...` images and dangling build layers, keeping the ROCm base images and the ccache
store so the next build neither re-pulls ~20 GB per line nor recompiles from cold.  Do **not** use
`podman system prune -a` for this (it takes the base images and ccache with it).

**The push also prunes the GHCR package.**  GHCR keeps every manifest ever pushed (an index plus one
version per architecture, plus whatever a moving tag left behind), so the package grows without bound;
`scripts/cleanup-ghcr.py` runs automatically on `--push` and deletes everything outside a rolling
`--keep-days` window (default **7**, one release cycle) while **always keeping the current base's
`*-<base>` tags** — the images just pushed can never be deleted.  `--no-cleanup` skips it.  A GitHub
bulk-delete throttle (secondary rate limit) is a warning, not a failure; re-run the tool to finish.

**Only ROCm 7.14.1 and 10.1 are built by default.**  7.2 (`-complete`) is much slower and is manual-only.

## What NOT to do

- Do not `git apply` the concatenated block series (drops hunks); use `scripts/apply-all.sh`.
- Do not hand-edit the committed patches as a permanent drift fix — regenerate and re-verify.
- Do not mix the historical `baseline/*` branches or `block/*` tags with the current `patches/`.
- Do not push anything from the `~/llama.cpp` checkout except the release-time `rdna-boosts` refresh
  to the personal fork (see the Pushing policy). Never push to upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp`.
- Do not present old docs as current: `MANIFESTS.md`/`BASELINE.md` are contracts, their dated history
  is in `archive/docs/`; current claims are their current-state headers + `patches/README.md` +
  `release.json` + the newest `WORKLOG.md` entry.
- Do not add new WIP experiments to the delivery set, and **never apply anything from `wip/`** or
  `archive/work/` unless the user explicitly asks for that specific item.

## Editing the docs

The docs have a freshness problem by design: historical records are kept, and the CURRENT state lives
in the current-state headers (`patches/README.md`, `README.md`, `MANIFESTS.md`, `BASELINE.md`,
`release.json`) plus the newest `WORKLOG.md` entry. When you change the delivery, update those headers
and add a new dated `WORKLOG.md` entry (newest first) — never edit dated validation records in place.

**Each top-level doc has one job — keep it that way.**  `README.md` describes the *set* (what it is, how
to apply it, what a consumer needs); `MANIFESTS.md` is the apply order + verification contract;
`BASELINE.md` is provenance + the drift policy; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` is the rulebook (claim, rule, numbers
per `§N`, with the narratives in `archive/docs/GREEDY-PURITY-FINDINGS.md`); `TODO.md` is
**forward-looking only** (open, waiting, accepted-limitation, parked — a closed item is one `WORKLOG.md`
entry, never a TODO entry); `ENVIRONMENT.md` is the variable catalogue.  **Release narrative belongs in
`WORKLOG.md` and nowhere else** — do not paste a release summary into `README.md`, `BASELINE.md` or
`MANIFESTS.md`; point at `WORKLOG.md` instead.

**WORKLOG dated headers use `YYMMDD.VVV`** (e.g. `## 261011.005 (r47) -- ...`).  `YYMMDD` is the
real local calendar date and `VVV` is a per-date, monotonically increasing 3-digit sequence number in
file order (the topmost/newest entry of a date carries the highest number).  The date is only a
date — never treat it as a version; the revision is the explicit `(rNN)` tag.  A new entry takes
today's real date and the next free number for that date.  Do not invent or extrapolate a future
date: if the work is done today, the header says today. Keep this file terse: policies, invariants and pointers only. Session/dev handovers belong
under `wip/` or `archive/docs/`, not at the repo top level.
