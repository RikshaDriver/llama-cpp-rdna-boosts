# The delivery patches — what each block is and what it does

**12 blocks** (block 00 + blocks 01-11) against `release.json.base`, one `git am` commit each.  This file
is the per-block reference: what a block contains, what it changes, the knobs its code reads and the
purity notes that constrain it.  It is **not** a changelog — the release-by-release record is
[`../WORKLOG.md`](../WORKLOG.md), the apply order and verification contract is
[`../MANIFESTS.md`](../MANIFESTS.md), provenance and drift policy is [`../BASELINE.md`](../BASELINE.md),
and every environment variable is catalogued in [`../ENVIRONMENT.md`](../ENVIRONMENT.md).

> **Dated notes.**  This file used to be the running record of block amendments (16-block numbering,
> `r1`..`r93`).  That history is preserved verbatim in
> [`../archive/docs/patch-notes-history.md`](../archive/docs/patch-notes-history.md) and is what
> `WORKLOG.md` entries and `archive/work/<campaign>/` records cite.  Everything below describes the
> **current** blocks in **V2.0** numbering.

## Apply

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp && cd llama.cpp
git checkout "$(jq -r .base /path/to/rdna-boosts/release.json)"
bash /path/to/rdna-boosts/scripts/apply-all.sh .          # creates branch rdna-boosts, 12 commits
bash /path/to/rdna-boosts/scripts/apply-all.sh --include-beta .   # + beta/*/*.patch (NOT the release tree)
```

All blocks with **`git am`**, in order.  `git apply` on the concatenated series silently drops hunks; the
manual equivalent is `git am patches/000[0-9]-*.patch patches/001[01]-*.patch`.  `apply-all.sh` asserts
the applied tree equals `release.json.tree` on the strict path.

## Block index

Sizes are `git diff` line counts against the block's parent (i.e. what that one commit adds), and matter
only as a rough shape.

Block 05's file count is `template-instances/*.cu` (the FA kernel instantiations); block 10's size is
dominated by `qwen4exp` + the slab/fusion translation units that were split out of `ggml-cuda.cu`.

## Block 00 — foundation: band uniformity, the Meta wrapper, the allocator

**What it is.**  The rules and the plumbing every later block assumes: *decode and verify must take the
same arithmetic*, the tensor-split wrapper must never abort on a legal graph, and the allocator must not
make output a function of the layout.  If a later block's purity claim is "one arm across `W = 1..8`", the
band rule it satisfies starts here.

**Contents.**

* **FA small-batch KV-split width invariance** (issue #25) — `launch_fattn`'s `parallel_blocks` heuristic
  maximised wave efficiency over `ntiles_dst`, a function of `Q->ne[1]`, so single-token decode and a
  verify batch grouped the online-softmax/PV partials differently.  It is evaluated as if `n_q == 1` for
  every `n_q <= 8` (`ntiles_dst_eff`); prefill (`n_q > 8`) is untouched.
* **CPU decode/verify band** — the llamafile `sgemm` path is gated to prefill (`n <= 8` takes `vec_dot`),
  because llamafile rejected `n < 2`, i.e. decode and verify accumulated differently on CPU.
* **Vulkan masked-V / freed-cell fixes** — `flash_attn.comp` / `flash_attn_cm1.comp` never read V for
  dead columns (baseline shaders, hence this block).
* **`-Wshadow` for the `llama` target** (GCC `-Wshadow=local`, clang plain) plus the rename sweep that
  makes it clean — the class of bug behind the 2026-09-11 dead-mask-chain finding
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §23).
* **`ggml-backend-meta`**: resolve a split-state through the view chain when the alias was never
  initialised (issue #170), return NULL from a failed per-device allocation instead of asserting (a
  clean OOM exit), and keep the split-state hot path at its pre-#170 shape with the #170 resolution in a
  `noinline, cold` helper.
* **`ggml-alloc`**: release view sources whose views are never consumed (a real leak), and fingerprint the
  graph layout by node order + output marking so a *different* graph cannot reuse a layout computed for
  another (issue #183).
* **`MUL_MAT_ID` repeated ids** — emit every `(token, iex)` occurrence as its own compact row and size the
  column grids for the expanded expert list (upstream bug; the delivery was the reproducer).
* **Shared-NextN MTP heads keep their own KV** — the draft driver inferred KV sharing from `ctx_other`
  alone, which is wrong for a `gemma4-assistant` head (upstream bug `04eb4c446`).
* **Multi-ubatch logits readback ordering** — the pinned async D2H copy is completed before the next
  ubatch runs, so a `llama-perplexity` `n_seq >= 4` run cannot read a torn readback.

**Files.**  `ggml/src/ggml-cuda/fattn-common.cuh`, `ggml-cuda/mmid.cu`/`mmf.cu`/`mmq.cu`,
`ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, `ggml-alloc.c`, `ggml-cpu/llamafile/sgemm.cpp`,
`ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/flash_attn*.comp`, `src/llama-{graph,context,model,kv-cache}.cpp`,
`src/CMakeLists.txt`, `src/models/*` (the shadow rename), `src/llama-grammar.cpp`, `common/speculative.cpp`.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_READBACK_SYNC` (diagnostic).  The rest are behaviour, not switches.

**Notes.**  Block 00 is the *only* block whose changes are not gated on RDNA: it fixes code paths every
backend shares.  A re-base conflict here is usually an upstream fix arriving for the same bug — keep
upstream's version and drop the local hunk.

---

## Block 01 — hybrid HIP all-reduce

**What it is.**  A device-side all-reduce for the small tensors `-sm tensor` reduces on every decode step,
plus a per-size hybrid dispatch: small tensors take the internal pipeline, large ones go to RCCL/NCCL.
Four files, ~2.4k lines, all in `allreduce-hip.cu` + `ggml-cuda.cu`.

**Contents.**  Internal host-staged pipeline and butterfly kernels; a wall-clock soft/hard spin budget so a
lagging rank fails soft instead of hanging (issue #139); eager `ncclCommInitAll` (a lazy mid-run init
perturbed the split compute and broke `-sm tensor -ncmoe` MTP purity); a first-runtime-failure fallback
that warns once, disables NCCL and re-routes to the internal path; an opt-in P2P/large path and an opt-in
copy-engine (SDMA) scratch path; and the `AR_PROFILE` device-list initialisation fix.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE` (`hybrid` default, `nccl`, `internal`, `meta`), `GGML_CUDA_AR_P2P*`,
`GGML_CUDA_AR_CE_SCRATCH_MIB`, `GGML_CUDA_AR_SPIN_TIMEOUT_MS` / `_HARD_MS`,
`GGML_CUDA_AR_SMALL_BLOCKS` / `_SMALL_BYTES`, `GGML_CUDA_AR_KER_EVENTS`, `GGML_CUDA_AR_PROFILE`.

**Purity.**  `GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE=nccl` is **not** bit-identical under `-sm tensor` (the internal pipeline
BF16-round-trips), so it is a smoke comparison, never a purity reference.  The hybrid dispatch's
small/large crossover must not move with batch width — the 2-device crossover was raised to the 3-device
value (131072 elements) for exactly that reason (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §11, cause A).

**Arch gate.**  The internal AR is RDNA4-only; on other arches it falls back to RCCL.  Cross-backend
consistency: the HIP split lives in `allreduce-hip.cu`, upstream's CUDA file is untouched.

---

## Block 02 — adaptive MTP draft depth

**What it is.**  The `draft-mtp-adaptive` speculator: a controller that sets the MTP draft depth from the
observed acceptance, instead of a fixed `--spec-draft-n-max`.  The tuned bucketed controller is the
shipped one (`delta = n_accepted - depth`, `climb_budget(d) = 20 + 6*(d-1)`,
`drop_pressure(d) = max(60, 10*d)`, cold start `max(floor, cap-3)`, `--spec-draft-n-start N`).

**Contents.**  `common/speculative-adaptive.h` + `.cpp` and the CLI plumbing
(`--spec-type draft-mtp-adaptive`, `--spec-draft-n-start`); the draft-depth clamp raised from 7 to 15
(`LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP=0` escapes it; purity is promised only to 7 — see
`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §11); an opt-in MTP prompt-tail ingest and a last-row prompt copy; a `--fit` SIGSEGV
fix with `draft-mtp-adaptive` (issue #38); `tests/test-speculative-adaptive.cpp` and
`tests/test-recurrent-state-depth.cpp`; and the **embeddings-layer-input preset API**
(`llama_model_set_embeddings_layer_inp_preset`) that the draft setup calls before the target context
reserves its compute buffers (r94 moved it here, the block that calls it).

**Knobs.**  `--spec-draft-n-max`, `--spec-draft-n-start`, `--spec-draft-p-min`,
`LLAMA_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX_CLAMP`, `LLAMA_MTP_INGEST_TAIL`, `LLAMA_MTP_DRAFT_OP_OFFLOAD`.

**Gate.**  Judge any controller change on the four axes (reasoning / prose / code / recall) **and** the
phase-switching prompt (`prompts/code-reasoning-mixed.txt`), at `-n 3000` (`-n 2000` floor),
`--reasoning on` for R and `off` for P/C/K.  Short runs are a correctness smoke test only
(`benchmarks/mtp-adaptive-methodology.md` rule 0).  Records:
`benchmarks/2026-09-15-adaptive-mtp-tuning.md`, `archive/work/adaptive-mtp-ceiling-scaling/`.

---

## Block 03 — chunked gated-delta-net prefill + the recurrent rollback tracker

**What it is.**  The fused chunked GDN prefill kernel (bf16/WMMA), shipped as **two arch-segregated
files**: the RDNA4 kernel (`gated_delta_net_chunked_bf16.cu`) and a first-gen-WMMA port for gfx11
(`gated_delta_net_chunked_bf16_gfx11.cu`), selected at runtime by device `cc`, with no-op stubs so the
host launchers link on either pass.  Plus the per-sequence rollback tracker, which is what makes a
speculative rewind into a prefill safe.

**Contents.**

* Chunked prefill is **K-independent**: threshold `max(K > 16 ? K : 16, n_rs_batch)`.
* **Rollback snapshots**: only the sequential kernel writes the `K = n_rs_seq + 1` snapshot planes, and a
  whole-batch rollback also needs a pre-batch plane (copied into slot `n_tokens` when
  `0 < n_tokens < K`).
* `prepare()` folds in **every** ubatch of a prepare list (r91) — recording only `ubatches.back()` made a
  sequence that ran in a non-final ubatch keep an earlier prefill chunk as its "last batch", which is what
  the issue-#131 warning was reporting.
* `LLAMA_RS_ROLLBACK_DEBUG` (`RSPREP`/`RSROLL`) is the instrument that proved both.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED=0` forces the sequential kernel (bit-identical, slow),
`GGML_CUDA_GDN_CHUNKED_BF16=0` forces the F32 chunked path, `LLAMA_RS_ROLLBACK_DEBUG` (diagnostic),
`GDN_DBG_*` (kernel-debug only).  The sequential-tail knob (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_TAIL`) is read by block 10's
copy of the launch site.

**Purity.**  The pure `none == draft-mtp` range is `n_max <= 7`; `n_rs_batch` is derived from the widest
enabled speculator (`common_speculative_n_max() + 1`, every draft *and* ngram type), so a verify batch can
never take the chunked path (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §27).  The BF16 chunked path was the issue-#113 prefill-logit
regression: **run `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh` on any change here.**

**Gates.**  `test-backend-ops -o GATED_DELTA_NET`, `test-recurrent-state-depth`,
`test-recurrent-state-rollback` (compare the per-arm FAIL/PASS *set*, never the count — it is per box).

---

## Block 04 — BF16 KV cache + native-BF16 flash attention

**What it is.**  Makes bf16 a first-class K/V cache type with a **native** FA path instead of an F16
conversion, and fixes the gfx11 masked-V signed-zero leak that a bf16 cache exposes.

**Contents.**  `V_DOT2_F32_BF16_AVAILABLE` for the RDNA3/3.5/4 targets (`common.cuh`); native-BF16 tile
instantiations for every head size plus a BF16→F16 converting load for the F16-math fallback
(`fattn-tile.cuh`); the tile case-type chooser and `launch_fattn`'s `need_f16_K/V` decision
(`fattn-tile.cu`, `fattn.cu`); the gfx11 signed-zero masked-V guard in `fattn-mma-f16.cuh` (a fully masked
KV row fed its `x + (-0.0)` products to the WMMA and leaked stale/freed content); `rope.cu` bf16 support;
`-Wshadow`/warning cleanup; the `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` head-size matrix in `tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`.

**Knobs.**  None — bf16 is a cache type (`-ctk bf16 -ctv bf16`).  The staging/native *policy* switch
(`GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE`) is block 05's.

**Purity.**  `-ctk`/`-ctv` must **match**: mixed K/V types are hard-rejected at context creation (every
mixed pair measured 1.7-3.6x slower and never smaller).

---

## Block 05 — the FA band, native quantized K-V, the derived kq mask

**What it is.**  The RDNA flash-attention work: a family of band kernels that serve the whole
decode/verify band with one reduction order, native (non-staging) reads of quantized K/V, and the derived
kq mask that removes the packed `n_kv × n_q` F16 mask from both compute and host memory.  287 files —
almost all of them `template-instances/*.cu`.

**Contents.**

* **The band kernels** (`fattn-rdna.cuh`): the RDNA4 head-256 GQA-6 band (the GQA group folded into
  `ncols2 = 8`, a round-robin KV split over a fixed `P`), extended to the 2-byte (f16/bf16) arm and capped
  by `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA_GQA_MAX` (default 12) for GQA-12 models.  Since r92 the 2-byte arm uses the
  same 32-column block as the quantized arm with a `nsm/2` band split.
* **The FA chooser band rule (F1)**: a quantized K/V cache took VEC for `n_q <= 2` and TILE from `n_q = 3`;
  both VEC conditions sit inside the band, so the branch is deleted and the band is TILE
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §14).
* **Native quantized K/V (V4/V5)**: the sub-F16 quant types (`q8_0`/`q4_0`/`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl`)
  read the cache natively instead of a whole-cache F16 conversion per decode step — a decode-*depth* win,
  and the margin that lets a high-context MTP config load (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §34).
* **`q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/`iq4_nl` as FA cache types** (previously reachable only via
  `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`, which also permits mixed K/V), each with its own band sweep and oracle
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §20-22).
* **The derived kq mask (V3)**: per-token bounds + one per-cell position replace the packed mask; the FA
  kernel computes visibility on the fly.  Implemented in **both** the MMA and the tile kernels, and only
  for prefill-shaped batches (`n_tokens > 8`), so decode/verify are untouched.
* **q8_0 fetch-ahead variant (r98, PR #195)**: with q8_0 K and V read in place (decode/verify, `n_q <= 8`,
  head 256) the band launches a second kernel, `flash_attn_ext_f16<..., band_fetch_ahead = true>`, that
  fetches the raw q8_0 bytes of the next K/V batches into registers ahead of use and converts each batch
  into shared memory only when it is due; its barriers order shared memory only, because `__syncthreads()`
  also waits for every outstanding global load and would drain the fetches.  Two generated translation
  units of its own (so the kernels without it compile to the same gfx1201 ISA), default on.  The
  instantiation rule the two generated files follow is in **Facts that span blocks**, below.
* **One tile K/V type selection + an RDNA2 checked tail (r99, PR #198)**: `ggml_cuda_fattn_tile_type(K, V, cc)`
  is the single source for both the tile instantiation and the F16 scratch sizing (they had drifted three
  times: the missing q4_0 arm, the mixed-K/V NaNs, the missing RDNA2 bf16 scratch).  On RDNA2 the last tile
  of the unchecked `ncols2 > 1` branch takes the already-compiled `oob_check = true` form, so an exact-size
  operand (test-backend-ops) cannot read into the neighbouring allocation; every other target compiles the
  branch unchanged.  The 511-row guard tail stays with its derivation documented.
* **RDNA3_0 head-512 WMMA rows (r102, PR #199)**: the RDNA head-512 rows of
  `ggml_cuda_fattn_mma_get_config_rdna` were tuned on gfx1201 and keep Q in registers, so on gfx1100 every
  head-512 kernel sat at the 256-VGPR limit and spilled ~1.0-1.4k VGPRs per lane — which is why head 512 was
  capped back to the tile kernel on RDNA3_0 in r5 (issue #30).  RDNA3_0 now has its own rows for
  `DKQ == DV == 512` (Q in shared memory, 128 threads, 64-wide K/V/combine batches, 16/32/64 columns) and
  head 512 takes WMMA prefill again on top of the 256 cap.  Other heads above 256 keep the tile kernel,
  RDNA4/RDNA3_5 rows are untouched, and the decode/verify band stays on the tile kernel.  +34 % deep prefill
  at d32768 / +45 % at d65536 on gfx1100 (gemma-4-26B-A4B QAT, q8_0 K/V), decode unchanged.  **This is a
  tile→WMMA family switch and the one FA arm in the set that does not meet the absolute prefill-logit gate**
  (mean KLD 0.0293 vs the tile kernel; the head-256 switch shipped since r5 measures 0.0441 at the same
  point) — see `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §46 and `TODO.md` #81.
* **Fully-masked KV group skip** (`GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP`, prefill only) — exact zeros, bit-identical.
* **Hygiene**: the `(512, 512, 32)` RDNA MMA row retuned to a 4-warp shape (issue #188, Gemma-4 head-512
  prefill), the RDNA2 (gfx1030) gate fixes of PR #181, the masked-V HIP fixes, and the FA staging arena
  (prealloc + graceful degradation instead of abort).

**Knobs.**  `LLAMA_KQ_MASK_DERIVED`, `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` (auto / force on / force staging),
`GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP`, `GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_WMMA*` (`_SPLIT`, `_GQA_MAX`, `_WIDE`),
`GGML_HIP_FA_BAND_FETCH_AHEAD` (r98; `=0` runs the q8_0 band kernel without the fetch-ahead variant),
`GGML_CUDA_FA_WMMA_256` / `_MAX_HEAD`, `GGML_CUDA_FA_RDNA3_WMMA_512` (r102; `=0` sends gfx1100 head 512
back to the tile kernel), `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` (build), `GGML_CUDA_OP_TIMING` (diagnostic).

**Purity.**  One arm across `W = 1..8` is the contract; the guarantee is per KV type
(`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §§11-14, 36).  **Any change to an FA kernel or the derived mask must pass
`scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh`** — decode-side coherence and MTP are blind to a uniform prefill shift.
The single documented exception is the r102 RDNA3_0 head-512 row set (§46), which is calibrated against the
family switches already shipped rather than against the absolute limit.

**Upstream candidates.**  `fa-kv-split-width` (block 00), `fa-decode-verify-kernel-family`,
`fa-512-rdna-head-cap`, `attn-k-null-mask-guard` — see [`../upstream/`](../upstream/README.md).

---

## Block 06 — MMB: the bf16-WMMA dequant-weight prefill GEMM

**What it is.**  A prefill GEMM (`mmb.cu`, ~2.4k lines) that dequantizes weights into bf16 WMMA fragments
on the fly, with per-arch and per-shape tuning: dense, routed/compact (MoE), GLU, F32-split, tall/narrow,
tiny-M, IQ3_XXS and HC16 variants, plus a shadow cache.  Adapted from `pwilkin`'s `strix-halo` fork.

**Contents.**  The `mmb` kernel family and its dispatch (`ggml-cuda.cu`); a per-quant type list
(`GGML_CUDA_MMB_TYPES`); per-arch RDNA3/RDNA4 tuning knobs; and
`tests/test-logits-width-probe.cpp` — the **width probe** that every purity claim in the delivery is
measured with.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_CUDA_MMB` (master switch), `_TYPES`, `_DENSE`, `_ROUTED`/`_ROUTED_THRESH`, `_GLU`/`_GLU_THRESH`,
`_F32SPLIT`(+`_MIN_K`/`_MIN_M`), `_TALL`(+`_MIN_M`), `_TINY_M`/`_TINY_TT`, `_DOWN16`, `_HC16`, `_IQ3XXS`,
`_RDNA3`, `_CFG`, `_CACHE`/`_SHADOW*`, `_MIN_T`, `_TILE`, `_BF16W`, `_LOG`; `LLAMA_MMB_CVT_LOG`.
Everything is default-on and documented in `ENVIRONMENT.md` §5.

**Purity.**  MMB changes prefill arithmetic, not decode: run the **prefill-logit gate** on any tuning
change, and the width probe when a fusion/dispatch predicate moves.

---

## Block 07 — k-quant boosts: `mmvq` VDR, Q6_K MMQ, Q1_0, grid pad

**What it is.**  The decode-numerics block.  `VDR` (vectors-per-thread reduction) for `Q4_K`/`Q5_K`/`Q8_0`
(2→4) and `Q6_K` (1→2), the RDNA3_5 `mmvq` parameter table split out of the RDNA2 fallback, a Q6_K MMQ
prefill path, the Q1_0 `__byte_perm` → `v_perm_b32` port, and a grid-stall pad.

**Contents.**  `vecdotq.cuh` (VDR constants + the `ggml_cuda_byte_perm` helper), `mmvf.cu` (the Q6_K
decode path), `mmvq.cu` (the VDR-aware K-split loop and the RDNA3_5 table), `mmq-vec-dot.cuh` /
`mmq-load-tiles.cuh` / `mmq.cu` (Q6_K MMQ), `common.cuh` (grid pad), and the Q1_0/Q6_K cases in
`tests/test-backend-ops.cpp`.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_CUDA_GRID_STALL_PAD`, `GGML_CUDA_MMQ_J_MAX`, `GGML_CUDA_OP_TIMING` (diagnostic).

**Purity.**  **This block changes decode numerics on every backend** — same real-number result, different
fp32 addition order.  Read `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §§1-9 before touching a VDR value: stock bits then require
re-cutting the set without this block (it is no longer the last patch, so it cannot be dropped with a
one-line edit).  A PPL run before/after is the gate: it must be **unchanged**.

---

## Block 08 — fused kernels (including the fused MoE gate+up+GLU)

**What it is.**  The CUDA fusion layer: matchers in `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` plus the kernels they dispatch to,
each one replacing a small chain of standalone launches, all constrained by the rule that a fused path
must be **bit-identical** to what it replaces at the widths it serves.

**Contents.**

* `mmvq.cu`: the dense `ncols == 1` K-split alignment, the fused dense gate+up+GLU, and (r93) the
  **RDNA3_0 per-shape `nwarps`** (`Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1` narrow at every row count, `Q8_0` narrow for
  `2048 <= M <= 8192`), forwarded to every fusion that reproduces a dense weight launch
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §19 addendum).
* `mmq.cuh` / `mmq.cu`: the fused MoE gate+up+GLU MMQ prefill, the routed-compact dispatch, `mul_mat_q_pair`,
  the FP4/gate precision contract, and the Q6_K compact-J path.
* `moe-weighted-reduction.cu`: the MoE weighted-down reduction (+ column-blocked band epilogue).
* `norm.cu` / `quantize.cu` / `unary.cu`: `rms_norm`→Q8_1 folds, the verify-band q8_1 cache, scale-unary,
  norm-rows, the conv1d/PLE fusions and the shared-expert down gate.
* `topk_moe`: the fused MoE router, made bit-identical to the softmax→argsort→get_rows→norm chain
  (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §31) with a sorted-key argmax and a stable tie-break.
* The **RDNA3_5 single-token-only fusion skip** (the dense GLU and the weighted-down tail are not
  decode/verify bit-identical), `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1` as the A/B.

**Knobs.**  `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_FUSION` (master), `_DISABLE_MOE_MMQ_FUSION`, `_DISABLE_MMQ_ROUTED`,

family (the qwen4exp/GDN fusions); the full catalogue is `ENVIRONMENT.md` §7.

**Purity.**  Every fusion carries the same requirement: one arm across `W = 1..8`, and — because some
matchers fire only at one width — the fused kernel must reproduce the standalone launch at that width
(`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §§39, 42, 25).  The `nwarps`/VDR choice is part of the reduction order: a
shape-scoped value must be forwarded to *every* kernel that reproduces that launch.

**Gates.**  `test-backend-ops -o MUL_MAT`/`MUL_MAT_ID`, the width probe on a MoE model, and the
stock-relative `llama-batched-bench -npl 1,4,8` arm.

## Block 09 — host-resident MoE: iface, scheduler, expert cache, staging rings

**What it is.**  Everything that makes `-ncmoe`/`-cmoe` (and `--host-experts`) fast and safe without
fitting the whole model on the device: a pinned host master, a per-op H2D staging ring, a scheduler that
can hand an op to a host-resident table, and the MoE expert cache that keeps the hottest experts in
whatever VRAM is left.

**Contents.**

* `moe-expert-cache.cu` (~5.1k lines) + `.h`: the cache engine — arena sizing, per-layer uniform slots,
  the slot remap, the routed-MMVQ decode/verify band (`moe_cache_band`), admission/heat policy, the
  persistent cross-run heat map (`MOE_EXPERT_HEATMAP`) and prefill cache staging.
* `ggml-cuda.cu`: the **op-offload H2D staging ring** (three invariants: prefill is never graph-captured,
  the width gate is floored at 64 tokens, the arena lives outside the compute-graph reserve), the pinned
  `ROCm_Host` master, the per-device host buffer types, and the base of the async graph-input ring.
* `ggml-backend.cpp`: the scheduler's staged cross-backend upload (including the cross-device
  `wait_before_overwrite` ordering that fixed issue #103), routed-expert rebalancing and env-read caching.
* **A second consumer of a staged expert table gets its own split** (r96, PR #186): a cache-managed
  `MUL_MAT_ID` whose weights are already an input of the current split now starts a new split, so the
  existing re-registration path stages them again for that consumer's own routing.  qwen4exp's gathered
  logits tail and its full-row MTP export tail are the motivating pair: merged, neither consumer could be
  served by the expert cache and the scheduler's guarded fast paths declined, so the last layer's whole
  table was copied for every prompt chunk on `-sm tensor` (-30 %/-47 % TTFT on follow-up turns,
  bit-identical text) and on `-sm layer` the second consumer read the arena slots staged for the first
  routing, which silently produced non-greedy-pure text with 0.00000 draft acceptance.  `GGML_SCHED_MOE_DUP_SPLIT=0`
  restores the merged split.  Invariant and evidence: `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §43.
* `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`: `MIRRORED` tensors serving arbitrary byte ranges and the per-device split of a
  host expert table.
* **The meta `get_tensor_async` reads an arbitrary row range** (r96, PR #189): it shares the synchronous
  read's split arithmetic instead of asserting `offset == 0` and one segment, so a caller can batch many
  per-device reads behind one `synchronize`.  Calls that worked before issue the same copies as before.
  The caller is block 11's batched state save.
* **The split-state pre-warm walk allocates no heap nodes** (r100, issue #184).  On a cache miss the
  per-buffer-context split-state cache walks the not-yet-cached ancestors on an explicit stack (the
  recursive form overflowed the thread stack on a 1200-node chain); its `wstack`/`wseen` containers
  allocated one heap node per visited tensor on **every graph re-allocation** — a 4-stream server
  re-allocates ~230 times per run, and the reporter's profile put 94 % of the `malloc` calls under
  `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph` in that set, ~4.7k split states and ~150k tensors per re-allocation.
  Both containers now use a reused per-thread `monotonic_buffer_resource` (1 MiB, released per walk).
  Only the outermost call walks, so the resource is never re-entered; the walk visits the same tensors
  in the same order and computes the same states (proven with `GGML_META_SS_VERIFY=1`, which recomputes
  every outer hit), and an exhausted arena falls back to the upstream allocator, so nothing is capped.
  `GGML_META_SS_SCRATCH=0` restores the heap containers (A/B and bisection only).
* **The copy callback is invoked again, so the upstream MoE cache works** (r99, TODO #56).  This block's
  rewrite of `ggml_backend_sched_copy_input` kept no `sched->callback_copy` call, and that call is the only
  driver of `llama_moe_cache::copy()`: with `--moe-cache-mib` set the slot map stayed `-1` while the graph had
  already swapped the routed op's `src0` for the cache bank, so `MUL_MAT_ID` indexed one expert below the bank
  (wrong values on gfx1201, an HSA fault on gfx1151).  Base's call is restored at base's position and in the
  branch with no `MUL_MAT_ID` consumer (where the slot map lands); the delivery's own expert branch is
  unchanged.  `sched_copy_experts` answers only for the upstream cache now.  Inert unless
  `--moe-cache-mib` is set; the upstream engine is correct but slower than `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB`.
* **The host-expert account keys a real device only** (r97): `moe_host_expert_account` skips a host
  buffer type that carries no device.  `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type()` is the plain **pageable** CPU
  buffer and has `.device = NULL` upstream (the FIXME in `ggml-backend.cpp`), so a CPU-only run, or
  `--override-tensor exps=CPU`, used to insert a null key and abort in `ggml_backend_dev_memory()` when
  the context auto-sized the staging ring — a CPU-only model could not create a context at all, and
  `test-llama-archs -a deepseek4` aborted on its first row.  A pageable master is not served by this
  block's machinery (the slab arena, the ring and the cache read the master in place from a device
  kernel, which needs a pinned buffer): it is copied by the upstream `llama_moe_cache` engine instead,
  so it must not be accounted.  Only a pinned host buft — which always carries its device — is
  accounted, and the per-device distribution is unchanged.
* **The `--fit` draft reserve charges only the KV a draft OWNS** (r101, campaign 0007).
  `common_draft_reserve_estimate()` charged the speculative draft a full `n_ctx` KV — 18022 of the
  19152 MiB it asked for per device — for a drafter that allocates **none**: `gemma4-assistant` declares
  `attention.shared_kv_layers = 4` and `llama_kv_cache`'s `layer_share_cb` reuses the target's tensors.
  It now reads `attention.shared_kv_layers` and charges `kv_layers - shared` (0 for
  `gemma4-assistant`); the indexer-cache term follows the same count and the log line reports the owned
  layers.  At the default 262144 context, gemma4 26B-A4B `-ncmoe 40 -sm layer` MTP n3: reserve
  19152 -> **1129 MiB**, arena 13752 -> **23141 MiB**, slots 4564 -> **7680**, `h` 0.897 -> **0.0000**,
  gen **41.0 -> 93.2 t/s** (plain 74.6).  Non-shared drafts are arithmetically unchanged (qwen4exp
  sidecar: `weights 2647 + kv 563 + compute 512 + slack 192`); an embedded MTP head never reaches the
  estimator.  (`common/draft-reserve.cpp`)
* **A loaded-but-unused draft model is not loaded, and gets no context** (r101, campaign 0011).
  `has_dft()` only means "`-md` was given", so `-md <gemma4-assistant> --spec-type none` used to load the
  model, create and warm up its context — which aborted, because the drafter's graph always needs the
  target's hidden state (`GGML_ASSERT(ubatch->embd_state)`).  `common_params_speculative::uses_dft()` /
  `has_aux()` (`common/common.h`) now gate the model load, the context creation, the MoE draft reserve
  and the preload on *an enabled type that actually drafts with a model*; `common_init_from_params`
  prints one WRN.  `-md X --spec-type none` is a working "plain baseline with the drafter loaded" and an
  unused drafter costs no VRAM.
* `common/fit.cpp`: `--fit` reserves the arena and the slab headroom per device.
* Host-side: mmap reclaim (`LLAMA_LOAD_RELEASE_MMAP`), rear-fill host layers
  (`LLAMA_HOST_EXPERTS_FROM_END`), `--host-experts pool` (`MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB`), a second draft scheduler
  (`LLAMA_DRAFT_SCHED2`), compute-buffer drop/re-reserve, and the CPU MoE-offload thread cap.
* **The batched f32 CPY run** (`cpy-batch.cu` / `.cuh`, r95): a run of up to 16 consecutive same-layout
  f32 `GGML_OP_CPY` nodes (the per-position DeltaNet conv-state snapshots of a speculative verify batch
  are the motivating shape) as **one launch**, element copies in `ggml_cpy`'s flat order, so
  bit-identical.  Admitted on **RDNA4 and RDNA3_0 (gfx1100-1102; gfx1101-gfx1102 not explicitly
  validated)**, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0` disables it, and the marker `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH_DEBUG=1`
  prints every run.  `ggml_cuda_cpy_batch_try_fuse` (block 10) is the caller; the fusion is skipped while
  a split's concurrent events are live, but it still fires heavily on a multi-device graph (measured
  ~450 runs under `-sm layer` / ~1350 under `-sm tensor` per 60-token MTP run on 3x gfx1201).
  RDNA3_0 multi-device is an **open, accepted gap** (no RDNA3_0 multi-GPU box).
* **The appended device-iface fills.**  Every `ggml_backend_device_i` / `ggml_backend_i` entry this set adds
  (`stage_gather`, `slab_ring_set`, `slab_narrow_floor`, `slab_reserve_wide`, `slab_narrow2_floor`,
  `slab_compute_narrow2`, `slab_compute_plain`, the slab-ring hooks, `moe_cache_*`) is wired here as a real
  hook (CUDA/Meta) or NULL/no-op (CPU, RPC, every other backend).  The list is **positional**: the block
  that declares a field must also fill it in every backend, or the initializer silently shifts (r94
  block-boundary repair; previously deferred to block 11, which does not build on its own).
* **The Meta split state accepts what a per-row / whole-row layout actually means** (r101,
  campaign 0008/0009/0010).  Three related additions to `ggml-backend-meta.cpp`, each "the split does not
  straddle the reduction, so the op is local":
  * `handle_per_row` (RMS/NORM/GROUP/L2 norm, `SUM_ROWS`, `ARGSORT`/`TOP_K`) accepts an **axis-0** split
    whose every per-device extent is either empty or the **whole row**.  gemma4's full-attention layers
    have one KV head, so the 512-wide K/V row lands whole on one device (`ne_per_dev=[0,512]`); a
    straddling split still aborts.  `handle_bin_bcast` gains the elementwise case for a split tensor
    against a **MIRRORED same-shape** operand (the per-head norm weight).
  * `handle_mul_mat` accepts (MIRRORED `src0`, axis-0 `src1`) when the contraction is empty-or-whole per
    device and `out->ne[0] == src1->ne[0]` — the **rotated KV cache** path (`-ctk q8_0` =>
    `n_rot_k = 512`), where the Hadamard rotation `rot[512,512] (MIRRORED) x Kcur[512, rows]` has its
    contraction on axis 0.  The owning device computes the whole dot product; nothing is summed across
    devices.  A straddling contraction still aborts, with a message saying it needs a cross-device
    reduction.
  * `handle_flash_attn_ext` accepts a K/V slice that is **empty-or-whole on every device** (with the
    query empty-or-whole on the same devices).  Needed when one ubatch carries several sequences
    (`n_stream > 1`: `llama-server -np > 1`, `llama-batched-bench -npl > 1`,
    `llama-perplexity --kl-divergence`), where the FA K/V cache view spans the cache's stream dimension
    and the state arrives on the cache's embd axis instead of the kv-head axis.
  Net effect: gemma4 dense + `-sm tensor` works, byte-identically to `-sm layer` (`c740be0e131a` at 2
  and 3 GPU) in f16 **and** rotated q8_0, including multi-sequence batches.  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45.
* **The expert cache sizes on gemma4, and a fused table is cacheable under `-sm tensor`** (r101, campaign
  0002/0003/0004a/0004b — TODO #77 A/B/C):
  * `moe_host_expert_account()` counts only routed expert **banks** (`ne[2] >= 2`).  gemma4 has a
    per-layer `ffn_down_exps.scale` (512 B x 30 layers = 15360 B), which made the cache's completeness
    check unsatisfiable: no arena was ever allocated, so every per-op expert upload was a miss
    (`-sm layer` 7.9 t/s, `-sm tensor` 5.5).  The completeness slack stays `min(max(1 MiB,
    expected/4096), 16 MiB)` — deliberately much smaller than one table (35B-A3B's is 36.4 MiB), because
    a wider slack silently accepts a sizing pass with one table unregistered (-3.6 % tg128).
  * A cache table's device slot may be assembled from up to **8 ordered host ranges** (gemma4's fused
    `ffn_gate_up_exps` is `[gate_slice | up_slice]` under `-sm tensor`), and one shared
    `fill_slot_from_host()` serves both the eager fill and the identity fill so the two cannot disagree.
    `ggml_backend_moe_slice` + the extended `moe_cache_update` in `ggml-backend-impl.h`; the scheduler
    call site passes `nullptr, 0`.
  * A **row-aligned segmented `set_tensor_async`** splice (per-device `set_async`/`set_2d_async` plus the
    MMQ tail pad); mid-row ranges keep the synchronous setter (the loader's chunked upload owns a staging
    ring that may be reused on return).  `GGML_META_SEG_ASYNC=0` disables it.
  Result: gemma4 26B-A4B `-ncmoe 40` `-sm layer` **79.0** / `-sm tensor` **74.7** t/s (was 7.9 / 5.0).
  The trap this fix invites is recorded in `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45.
* **The async graph-input ring is keyed per ORIGIN** (r101, campaign 0005): its ordering state
  (`pending`/`ev`/`q`/`flush_ev`/`done_ev`) was per **device**, but a stream is a `llama_context`, so
  MTP's draft and target contexts consumed each other's queued uploads and a context could replay a graph
  without waiting for its own copy.  A genuine cross-context bug (the MTP run-to-run nondeterminism that
  looked like its symptom was ROCm's hipBLASLt per-start solution pick, issue #67 — see
  `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §44).
* **The iSWA KV builder expands `q, v, k`** (r101, campaign 0001 — TODO #76): the r81 rope + FWHT fusion
  folds the two q8_0 K/V cache `SET_ROWS` launches into the fused rope kernel, but
  `build_attn(llm_graph_input_attn_kv_iswa*)` expanded `q, k, v`, so the V block sat between the K
  rotation and the K cache write and the matcher declined — **inert on every iSWA arch**.  Now mirrors
  the non-iSWA builder.  Measured on gemma4 12B q8_0: `k_set_rows_q8_0_group` 1152 -> 192 launches,
  `rms_norm_mul_rope_f32<...,kv=true>` 0 -> 480, total 13500 -> 12540; greedy text and
  `test-logits-width-probe` identical, `llama-bench` tg128 +0.6 %.  Known gap: gemma4's 512-wide
  full-attention layers stay outside the fused kernel (its `fwht_n` set is `{64,128,256}` and the V-row
  write assumes `ncols <= 256`).
* **A speculative verify batch never exceeds `n_batch`** (r101, campaign 0006): a verify batch carries
  `n_max + 1` tokens in one `common_batch::get()`, capped by `llama_n_batch()`, so `-b 1` aborted in a
  server worker after the model had loaded.  `common_init_from_params` raises `n_batch` to `n_max + 1`
  with a WRN (a logical-batch hint; `-ub` still bounds the per-launch memory).
* **The pre-loaded draft-model handoff** (r86; ownership completed in r94):
  `common_speculative_load_model`, the 4-argument `common_speculative_init_result` / `init_from_params`,
  and `common_init_result::take_draft_model` live in this block together, so the draft model is resident
  before the target context sizes the slab.  A caller and its definition must not be split across blocks.

**Knobs.**  `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB` (auto default; `0` disables), `_MIN_MIB`, `_MIN_RES_PCT`,
`_RESERVE_MIB`, `_AUX_RESERVE_MIB`, `_UNIFIED` (APU opt-in), `_VALIDATE*`, `MOE_EXPERT_HEATMAP[+_DIR]`,
`MOE_HOST_POOL_MIB` / `MOE_HOST_POOL_FRAC`, `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK`, `GGML_MOE_GATHER_ONCE`,
`GGML_CUDA_SLAB`/`_RESERVE_MIB`/`_HEADROOM_MIB`/`_MIN_ARENA_MIB`/`_RING_MIB`/`_CHUNK_MIB`,
`GGML_COMPUTE_BUFFER_MARGIN_PCT`/`_CHUNK_MIB`, `GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT`, `GGML_SCHED_STAGE*`,
`GGML_STAGE_*`, `LLAMA_LOAD_RELEASE_MMAP`, `LLAMA_DROP_COMPUTE_BUFFERS`, `LLAMA_DROP_EXTRA_RESERVE_MIB`,
`GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS`, `GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD`, `LLAMA_TENSOR_HOST_BUFT`,
`GGML_HIP_GRAPH_FORCE_UPDATE`, `GGML_META_SS_VERIFY`, `GGML_META_SS_SCRATCH`, `GGML_SCHED_MOE_DUP_SPLIT`.

**Invariants.**  Host experts are always pinned; a partially failed cache **falls back wholesale**; no
arena is freed while a kernel carrying its address is in flight; the slab is **MoE-only** (armed solely by
the MoE preflight — never enable it for a dense model); a `-ncmoe` host table is split per device, not
mirrored (`GGML_META_SPLIT_COPY=1`); a staged expert table gets **one consumer per split** (a second
`MUL_MAT_ID` consumer of the same weights starts its own split, because the cache arena can only hold one
routing's slots — `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §43).

**Gates.**  Host-expert coherence (`-ncmoe`/`-cmoe`, and `cache-on == cache-off` text), `test-llama-archs`,
`MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_VALIDATE=1`, `scripts/check-gpu-faults.sh` on the run's journal + log.

## Block 10 — qwen4exp, the slab, the fusion dispatcher, the async input ring

**What it is.**  The largest block, and the one that owns the translation units split out of
`ggml-cuda.cu`: the qwen4exp (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next) model support, the movable-boundary **slab** allocator,
the `ggml_cuda_try_fuse` dispatcher, the async graph-input ring's batched uploads, and the qwen4exp-family
fusions.

**Contents.**

* **qwen4exp** (`src/models/qwen4exp.cpp`, `src/llama-memory-hybrid-idx.cpp`): QSA sparse attention and the
  fused indexer top-k/score (`indexer-topk.cu`, `lightning-indexer`), hyper-connections (`hc-mix.cu`,
  `hyperconn.cu`), the managed lazy reader, PLE n-gram loading, the MTP draft head, and the **keys-only
  indexer cache** (`LLAMA_QSA_KEYS_ONLY`; no V tensor at all).
* **The slab** (`ggml-cuda-slab.cu`, `ggml-cuda-arena.cu`): one VMM reserve per device split by a movable
  boundary — compute below, MoE arena above, no HIP call at runtime.  Plus the narrow-band learning, the
  wide-phase auxiliary region, pool-wide routing, and the slab transient absorption.
* **The fusion dispatcher** (`ggml-cuda-try-fuse.cu`): the matcher arms moved out of `ggml-cuda.cu`.
* **Rope/FWHT fusions** (M-RoPE and NEOX, with the q8_0 K/V cache `SET_ROWS` folded in), the paired GDN
  q/k norms, and the `ADD + rms_norm_q8_1` one-token fusion (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §42).
* **The GDN / attention-gate decode fusions** (r102, PR #200): four bit-identical fusions with their own
  switches — the qwen4exp alpha/beta BF16 projections plus `softplus(alpha + dt) * a` in one
  `mul_mat_vec_f` launch (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GATE_BETA_BF16`), the q/k l2 norm pair folded into the direct conv
  kernel (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_NORM`), the attention gate's row-strided view read in place by the
  gate → Q8_1 kernel so its `CONT` copies nothing (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CONT_GATE_Q8_1`), and qwen4exp's GDN
  output `RMS_NORM * w` computed inside the gate kernel (`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_NORM_GATE`).  Two correctness
  rules came with them: the conv-norm fold is taken only when both SCALE outputs are disjoint from the
  conv's `x`/state/weight/output (the allocator may place them over the state or `x`, which the direct
  kernel still reads — without the check 35B-A3B varied run to run), and the GDN-norm fold has its skip and
  its emit at two different nodes, so **while a norm is pending no other fusion may start before its gate
  node** and the pending norm's own (dead) `MUL` is skipped.  With that guard the two abort tripwires the
  submitted form carried are unreachable rather than merely unlikely.
* **The verify-band arch extension** (r95, PR #192 + PR #193):
  `ggml_cuda_should_fuse_mul_mat_vec_q(..., verify_band = true)` admits **RDNA3_0** as well as RDNA4 via
  one `verify_band_arch` term.  That predicate is the single gate the three 2..8-token Q8_1
  pre-quantize fusions share — residual `ADD` + `rms_norm` → Q8_1, plain `rms_norm` → Q8_1, and gated
  unary → Q8_1 (plus the `GLU` → Q8_1 mark) — so one change admits all of them; their kernels are
  row-generic and write the values `quantize_q8_1` writes, so `W = 1..8` stay bit-identical.
  `gdn-conv.cu`'s `verify_ok` takes the same `(RDNA4 || RDNA3_0)` form, so the direct GDN conv covers
  the 2..255-token verify batches too and keeps its pre-existing single-device restriction.
  `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_Q8_1_VERIFY=0` / `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_VERIFY=0` still disable them; RDNA3_5 is
  excluded by the macro (`0x1100 <= cc < 0x1150`).
* **The DSV4_HC_POST arm is chosen by the split mode** (r97).  The `hc_combine_norm` chain spelled out
  (scale → sigmoid → scale → repeat → mul → add → rms → mul) is faster than the op on **one** device
  (+0.9..+1.8 % prefill on qwen4exp IQ4_NL, gfx1151) and stays the default there, but the chain's
  broadcasts are split-state sensitive and it is **not correct under the Meta (tensor-split) device**:
  `test-llama-archs -a deepseek4` on 3× gfx1201 read NMSE 1.74e-01 vs the CPU reference through the
  chain and 6.5e-06 through the op.  `cparams.fused_dsv4_hc_post` therefore defaults to *on* whenever a
  Meta device is in play and to *off* otherwise; `LLAMA_FUSED_DSV4_HC_POST` still forces either arm.
* **The ring's teardown flush is unconditional** (r97): `ggml_cuda_async_input_flush_done` early-returned on
  `!g_async_input_on`, but since r90 the ring also carries the `set_tensor_async` snapshots *unconditionally*,
  so `GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT=0` left a pending done-event naming the stream the context destructor destroys
  and the next context on that device recorded on the dead handle (`invalid resource handle`).  A no-op when
  nothing is pending; both arms now give the same results.
* **Async graph-input ring**: batched uploads + lazy done event (PR #182), and the r90 fix that snapshots
  the source through the pinned ring — the scheduler uses `set_tensor_async` for a *CPU split's* output,
  which the next ubatch rewrites, so a direct copy from the caller's live pointer could read the next
  ubatch's bytes.  Default-on; `GGML_CUDA_ASYNC_INPUT=0` disables.
* **`GGML_CUDA_GDN_TAIL`**: the fixed-`D` sequential tail that makes a chunked-GDN prefill batch write its
  rollback snapshots (r91; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` §27).
* Graph-memory generations (`GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_MEM_GEN`) so a graph is recaptured when the pool / FA staging /
  H2D ring memory it captured is freed, **and when `ggml_cuda_slab_work_alloc` shrinks the work boundary**
  (the post-prefill drop hands the wide region back to the arena; a captured graph baked its addresses).
  Issue #187: without that invalidation a 4-stream MTP decode replayed a stale `set_rows` source and
  faulted with `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION`.

**Knobs.**  The slab/cache set listed under block 09, plus `GGML_CUDA_POOL_WIDE[_MIN_MIB]`,

**Split-state rule (r101).**  The Meta handlers may only accept a split the op can serve **locally**:
empty-or-whole per device for a per-row op, for a rotated-K `mul_mat`, and for the FA K/V of a
multi-sequence ubatch; a split that straddles the reduction is rejected, never approximated.  Every new
acceptance must come with the same-shape refusal for the straddling case (`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §45).

**Purity.**  qwen4exp's decode/verify band is `HC_FUSED_MAX_TOKENS = 8` and the QSA decode arm band is
`max(8, n_rs_batch)`; the arm must be chosen from the band and `n_kv`, never `n_tokens == 1`
(`GREEDY-PURITY.md` §§13, 16, 26, 32, 38).  The QSA op has a CPU oracle — run
`test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_QSA` (18/18 minimum) and the sparse-vs-dense perplexity ratio, because the
`W = 1..8` matrix cannot see a width-uniform bug (§21).  Also run `scripts/gate-qwen4exp-quant-coherence.sh`
before changing the device gather or the head zero.

**Gate.**  Debugging the slab or the arena: `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_STATS=1` (arm/drop/destructor accounting,
`hole=0` and `outside_failed=0` are the acceptance signals).

## Block 11 — campaign remainder

**What it is.**  The tail of the campaigns: CPU wins, the backend-iface fills that every non-CUDA backend
needs for the new hooks, DFlash, the FA instance build grouping, and the small allocator/model fixes that
had no other home.

**Contents.**

* **CPU wins**: an AVX2 block prefilter in the sampler (block max + NaN detection over 64 logits, with the
  scalar fallback preserved), and an AVX2 Q2_0 dot product that reproduces the generic two-rounding
  arithmetic bit-for-bit.
* **DFlash**: the F1 device-resident layer-input path made default-on with a warn-once fallback
  (`GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV=0` disables), `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK`, and the clean `-sm tensor` rejection for a
  DFlash2 selector (a Meta distributed top-k is unstarted — TODO #78).
* **Allocator/model**: `ggml_gallocr_drop_buffers` (free compute buffers and invalidate the layout so the
  next reserve sizes from the current graph), the per-device `max_host_expert_slice_bytes` split rule, the
  application of the embeddings-layer-input preset, and the `-sm tensor` H2D-ring auto-size + narrow-band
  pin.
* **The batched state save** (r96, PR #189): `llama_io_write_host` queues its deferred reads as
  `ggml_backend_tensor_get_async` into one pinned staging buffer kept by the context, synchronizes each
  backend once, then copies to the caller's buffer.  A recurrent model's checkpoint is about 75 small
  ranges, and under `-sm tensor` each was one synchronous read per device, so a checkpoint paid about 150
  device syncs before every prompt chunk of a follow-up turn (Flash-Next + MTP: -55 ms/-59 ms TTFT,
  isolated by the same-binary `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC=0` arm).  States above `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC_MAX_MIB` and any
  state with a tensor no context backend owns keep the synchronous path, and restores are unchanged.  The
  file also gains `#include <algorithm>` (the patch as submitted does not compile without it).
* **Build time**: one FA template instantiation TU per `(ncols1, ncols2, head size)` instead of per
  `(ncols1, ncols2)` — same instantiations, grouped so the backend build is no longer one-file-bound.
* **The expected `--fit` probe failure logs as a warning** (r101, campaign 0012): `--fit` builds the extra
  (draft) model's context before the target context exists, so an arch that needs `ctx_other` fails there
  by design and fit falls back to the derived reserve.  `E llama_init_from_model: failed to initialize the
  context: … requires ctx_other to be set` is now a **W**; any other init failure stays an **E**.
* **The draft-context creation is gated on an enabled type that uses it** (r101, campaign 0011, the
  `common/speculative.cpp` half — see block 09 for the predicate in `common/`): with `--spec-type none`
  the extra model is neither loaded nor given a context, so the gemma4 drafter's warm-up decode no longer
  aborts on the missing state embedding.

**Knobs.**  `LLAMA_OUTPUT_PINNED`, `MTP_DRAFT_N_UBATCH`, `GGML_LF_DFLASH_DEV`, `GGML_LF_FAST_TOPK`,
`LLAMA_STATE_GET_MERGE_GAP`, `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC`, `LLAMA_STATE_ASYNC_MAX_MIB`,
`GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS`, `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_RING_MIB`.

**Notes.**  A backend-iface entry is a compile-time contract: adding one to the struct means adding it to
**every** backend's initializer, or the build breaks for that backend.  Keep the difference documented when
a hook is CUDA-only (the non-CUDA entries stay NULL and the feature is simply inactive).

## Facts that span blocks

* **The band rule.**  Decode and every speculative verify width must take the same kernels, chosen from the
  `n_tokens` band and `n_kv` — never from the exact width.  Blocks 00/03/05/06/08/10 each contribute a piece
  of it; `GREEDY-PURITY.md` is the rulebook.
* **A block owns its code.**  A fix goes into the block whose surface it changes (even an early block); the
  per-block build gate (`scripts/gate-per-block-build.sh`) exists because appending fixes to the last block
  once broke blocks 06-14 silently.
* **Cross-backend consistency.**  The set is AMD-targeted but generic code: a new predicate, KV type or
  iface entry must stay consistent on every backend (an inconsistent set is a crash on whichever backend
  reaches it).  Behaviour/perf on non-AMD is out of scope — see AGENTS.md.
* **RDNA4 is the reference arch.**  The WMMA FA path, the chunked-GDN kernel and the VDR work were built
  and validated there first; RDNA3.0/3.5 get back-ports (their own kernel files, tuned head caps, their own
  `mmvq` parameter table) and RDNA2 is best-effort.
* **The arch gate is runtime** everywhere in the set, so one multi-arch binary picks the right path.
* **`ggml-cuda.cu` is shared by blocks 00/07/08/09/10** and is the usual re-base conflict site; the
  `template-instances/*.cu` files are block 05's and are generated (`generate_cu_files.py`).  A new FA
  kernel variant also goes into its own generated instance file, never implicitly into the dispatch TU:
  `nm -C` shows the kernel `W` in the instance TU and `U` in the `...-case-...` TU that selects it (the
  r98 q8_0 fetch-ahead variant is `fattn-mma-f16-band-fetch-ahead-ncols1_{4,8}-ncols2_8-dkq256-dv256.cu`).
  Give it its own TU whenever the two arms would otherwise change each other's compiled code.
* **A knob's `getenv` call site may land in a later block than the feature it controls** (the series is
  linear and `ggml-cuda.cu` accumulates): `ENVIRONMENT.md` is authoritative for what a variable does and
  its default, and `git grep` on the applied branch for its call sites.  A block's "knobs" list here is the
  set its own hunks read/write, not a claim of exclusive ownership.
