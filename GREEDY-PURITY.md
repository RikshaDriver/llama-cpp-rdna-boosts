# Greedy purity — the rulebook

**What this is.**  The delivery's purity contract, one entry per finding: the claim, the rule a change
must satisfy, the numbers that back it, and where the record lives.  Read the entry for the `§` you are
about to touch; read the seven invariants before shipping anything that changes a decode or prefill
kernel.

**Where the rest is.**  The investigation narratives (how each finding was made, which instruments failed,
which false trails were ruled out) are in
[`archive/docs/GREEDY-PURITY-FINDINGS.md`](archive/docs/GREEDY-PURITY-FINDINGS.md) under the same `§`
numbers.  The delivery-side record of each amendment is in `patches/README.md` and `WORKLOG.md`.  Section
numbers are **stable** — dozens of docs cite them — so they are never renumbered; new findings append.

> **Numbering.**  This document uses the **V2.0 12-block** numbering for new text.  Entries written
> before 2026-10-13 use the **pre-V2.0 16-block** numbering ("block 10" = the k-quant/VDR umbrella, now
> **block 07**; "block 13" = fused MoE/`mmvq`, now **block 08**; "block 14" = qwen4exp, now **block 10**;
> "block 15" = the campaign remainder, now **block 11**).  §39/§40 appear twice in the original numbering;
> the later pair is labelled **§39b/§40b** here.

## The invariants (everything below is evidence for these)

1. **Inside the decode/verify band, one arm — chosen from the `n_tokens` band and `n_kv`, never from the
   exact width, `n_kv` alone, or `n_tokens == 1`.**  A W=1 decode and a W=(`--spec-draft-n-max` + 1)
   verify of the same state must take the same kernels (§§11, 13-17, 25, 26, 32).
2. **A batch you can roll back into must be written by the kernel whose snapshots you read** — the
   rollback bound is a purity bound, not a tuning knob, and it is derived from the widest enabled
   speculator, not from the snapshot depth (§27).
3. **Same real-number result, different rounding order.**  The k-quant/fused-MoE numerics changes are
   exactly that; stock is the reference *standard*, not the mathematically special order (§§1-9).
4. **A newly enabled KV type / op argument / fusion is a new kernel family** and needs the full band
   sweep, the text gate, the oracle and the perplexity comparison (§§20-22, 29).
5. **Purity outranks raw non-MTP throughput**: land bit-identical decode/verify even at a few percent of
   the widest verify batch, record the delta, then repay it structurally (§§19, 24).
6. **Use the instrument that can see the defect**: the raw-logit width probe for boundaries, a CPU
   reference or the dense-masked path for a fused tensor op, random text for a causal leak, and an
   *executed-graph* dump when a chain looks dead (§§11, 21, 23).
7. **A prefill-logit shift is a purity failure even when decode is clean.**  Same-seed text and MTP
   sample the decode distribution *from the post-prefill state* and cannot see a uniform prefill shift;
   run the prefill-logit KLD gate (`benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`) before shipping a prefill
   kernel.  Issue #113: the default-on BF16 chunked GDN passed coherence at mean KLD 0.03.
8. **A shape-scoped launch parameter must be forwarded to every kernel that reproduces that launch.**
   `nwarps` / `rows_per_block` / VDR are width-uniform only if the fused single-token kernels that
   replace a dense weight launch call the same selector (§19 addendum, §39).
9. **A split the op cannot serve locally must be rejected, never approximated.**  The Meta backend may
   accept a split only when no device **straddles the reduction** (empty-or-whole per device): a per-row
   op over whole rows, a rotation `mul_mat` over a whole contraction, and a flash-attention K/V slice that
   is whole on one device.  The straddling case must stay a hard refusal with a message saying it needs a
   cross-device reduction (§45).
10. **A cross-start comparison is only a purity measurement if the external solution selection is pinned.**
   On ROCm before the `rocm-libraries` fix, hipBLASLt picks its solution for an untuned FP32 GEMM size in
   heap order — a **per-process-start** lottery (§44).  Compare fresh-process arms with
   `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`, and attribute a per-start difference to the library before blaming a kernel,
   a graph or a cache: every graph/capture arm of the r100 MTP hunt was this lottery (§44).

---

## 1. The one-sentence version

The k-quant VDR work (pre-V2.0 "block 10", now **block 07**) does not make decode more or less *correct*
than stock — it computes the **same real-number result** through a **different order of fp32 additions**.
Stock is not the mathematically special order; it is the *reference standard* that shipped first and that
everything else reproduces.

## 2. What block 10 changes

Two mechanisms, both in the `mmvq` decode path, and nothing else in the block changes production numerics
(the MMQ scale-load hoist, the MoE `mmid` whitelist and the perf-harness cases are arithmetic-preserving or
test-only):

| mechanism | change | effect |
|---|---|---|
| **VDR** | `VDR_Q4_K/Q5_K/Q8_0 2→4`, `VDR_Q6_K 1→2` | each thread accumulates 4 (or 2) chunk partials serially instead of 2 (or 1) |
| **RDNA3_5 parameter table** | split from the RDNA2 fallback, `nwarps=2` for Q8_0 on gfx1151 | fewer warps → different cross-warp combine tree |

## 3. The reduction structure

The dot products are **exact** (`ggml_cuda_dp4a` is an integer SIMD dot product; the scale multiplies are
single multiplies); only the **fp32 accumulation** can round.  The per-thread serial chain
(`tmp[j][i] += vec_dot(...)` once per `blocks_per_iter`) and the cross-thread combine (shared-memory across
warps, then `warp_reduce_sum`'s hard-coded `16,8,4,2,1` shuffle butterfly) are **identical** in stock and
in the boosted path.  What changes is *which* partial sums feed which leaves of that tree.

## 4. Why VDR changes the rounding path

`blocks_per_iter = vdr * nwarps*warp_size / qi` and `kqs = vdr * (tid % (qi/vdr))`, so VDR sets the
per-thread serial chain length and the thread-to-chunk assignment.  The *set* of partial products is
unchanged; the **association order** is not.

*A note on "fewer rounding accumulations".*  VDR=4 does **fewer** serial rounding steps per thread, not
more (the outer `tmp +=` chain runs half as often, ~17 % fewer serial fp32 adds).  "The boosted path rounds
more" is the wrong intuition, and neither path is provably closer to the exact result.

## 5. What "correctness" means here

* **Same real-number result** — no approximation is introduced.
* **Stock is not more correct** — its ordering was chosen for performance on the hardware of the day.
* **Bit-identity is a reproducibility requirement, not a correctness one** — golden vectors, cross-build
  harnesses, `verify == decode` batches, audit trails.  Reproducing stock's bits means reproducing its
  exact association order, which is why the block is structured as one excludable patch.

## 6. Speculative decoding composes orthogonally

The verify batch runs the *same* `mmvq` kernels at `ncols_dst = n_draft+1`.  Two invariants keep it
bounded: **VDR is per-type, not per-column-count**, and the `ncols_dst <= MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` rule forces
the verify batch onto decode's `nwarps`.  So the acceptance criterion still reproduces the target
distribution exactly.

| | temp = 0 (greedy) | temp > 0 (stochastic) |
|---|---|---|
| effect | a ≤0.184 logit drift can flip near-tie acceptances → a different greedy stream | the drift perturbs probabilities, not decisions; acceptance *rate* may shift slightly |
| correctness | none — both are valid deterministic paths | none — the distribution is preserved; PPL is bit-unchanged |

## 7. Measured magnitude of the variance

| metric (gfx1201, ROCm 7.14) | value |
|---|---|
| max abs logit diff, block 10 in vs out | **0.184** |
| same, flash-attn on vs off (yardstick) | 0.203 |
| per-token probability change at the worst logit (t=1.0) | ~20 % |
| top-2 logit gap typically | 0.5-5 nats (0.184 is ~9 % of a 2-nat gap) |
| PPL (wikitext-2, Q8_0) | identical to pre-block-10 |
| greedy streams | deterministic within a build; 1 of 3 prompts diverged at one character |

**Honest framing:** 0.184 is *not* vanishingly small (~20 % relative probability on the single worst
token), but it is a **max** over all tokens, PPL is bit-identical, and greedy flips need a near-tie.  If you
need stock's bits, exclude the block; if you need a correct, deterministic, high-quality model, the block
is fine.

## 8. Practical guidance

* Within a build, greedy output is fully deterministic — the variance appears only across *builds*.
* To reproduce stock bits, exclude the k-quant block (**V2.0 `0007`**).  In V2.0 that is **no longer a
  one-line drop**: `0007` is mid-series and later blocks edit the same `mmvq.cu` region, so the set must
  be re-cut without it (pre-V2.0 it was the last patch).  Do not apply it partially or hand-tune VDR in
  production.
* A/B on **distributions** (PPL, benchmark scores, sampling quality), not individual greedy tokens.

## 9. The fused-MoE `mmvq` rewrite is a second decode-numerics source

Pre-V2.0 block 13 (now **block 08**) replaces the §3 K-split loop with an item-split over
(token, row, kblock) plus an RDNA `rows_per_block` override, feeding different partial sums into the same
tree.  The 2026-09-02 fix restored `ncols 2..8` and `ncols==1` with `K >= 4096` to the K-split kernel, so
dense long-K decode is back to block-10-only variance; the remaining surface is `ncols==1` with `K < 4096`
(MoE down/router and other short-K projections).  Multi-token MoE decode takes the unfused path (the
`rms_norm`→Q8_1 fold is gated off `MUL_MAT_ID`), and single-token MoE carries fusion-ordering drift.

**Consequence:** reproducing stock bits with this block installed is not a one-line drop; the `ksplit`
dispatch condition in `mul_mat_vec_q_switch_ncols_dst` is the gate.

## 10. Block 00 makes the verify width irrelevant on the small-batch FA path

`launch_fattn`'s `parallel_blocks` keyed off `ntiles_dst` (a function of `Q->ne[1]`), so single-token
decode and a verify batch grouped the online-softmax/PV partials differently and produced different logits
(issue #25).  Block 00 evaluates the heuristic as if `n_q == 1` for every `n_q <= 8`, so decode and every
verify width reduce identically.  `n_q = 1` can still differ from a verify batch because the FA *kernel* is
selected from `Q->ne[1]` — a decode-vs-verify difference, not a draft-length one.

## 11. The real purity range: `n_max <= 7`

The boundary is on the **verify batch width** (`K = n_max + 1`), not on `n_max`.  Two causes:

* **Cause A (fork-specific, FIXED):** the size-based all-reduce dispatch switched to NCCL above a
  per-device-count element count, and the two paths are not bit-identical (the internal pipeline
  BF16-round-trips).  Under `-sm tensor` the reduced tensor scales with the batch width, so a 7-token
  verify crossed the old 2-device limit.  The crossover is now 131072, and MTP throughput *rose*
  (+12 % at `n_max 6` and 12) because the internal pipeline is faster at these sizes.
* **Cause B (deliberate):** the FA tile→WMMA switch at `Q->ne[1] > 8`, and (with FA off) the
  `mmvq`→`MMQ` switch at `ncols == 8`.  Beyond the band the fast kernels have a different reduction
  order; keeping the guarantee would mean giving up WMMA for 9..N-token batches.  There is **no
  corruption** in 1..15 (deterministic recurrent-state sweep).

**Rules.**  Use the **raw-logit probe, not the text gate**, to establish a boundary (text equality is
evidence *for* purity, never *against* divergence — near-ties are rare).  Above the range, gate on
acceptance + MTP-vs-plain throughput; adaptive MTP's `n_max = 12` is deliberately outside.  Upstream is
worse: on `9cf3bf256` (CPU) it diverges at the first width step.

**RDNA3_0 joins the band (r95).**  The boundary above is about the *kernels* a width selects, not about
an architecture, so RDNA3_0 (gfx1100-1102) takes the same verify-band fusions RDNA4 has had since r78:
the 2..8-token Q8_1 pre-quantize fusions (through the one `ggml_cuda_should_fuse_mul_mat_vec_q(...,
verify_band)` predicate all three share), the direct GDN conv for 2..255-token batches, and the batched
f32 `GGML_OP_CPY` run.  It is a **purity** claim, not only a performance one, and it is measured at the
widths:

| gfx1100, `KV=q8_0`, default vs all three fusions off | row 0, `W=1..8` | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 27B UD-Q4_K_M, P=256 | `c37241bd00c1d561` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |
| 27B UD-Q4_K_M, P=3584 | `86541410b7c618b0` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |
| 30B-A3B Q4_K_M, P=256 | `899608bf91600e1b` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |
| 30B-A3B Q4_K_M, P=3584 | `63ee46bb518130a7` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |
| 35B-A3B Q4_K_M, P=256 | `423a5f353f0a0e45` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |
| 35B-A3B Q4_K_M, P=3584 | `6cdc0c5a6601264d` (both arms) | PASS, worst maxdiff 0 |

Same-binary kill-switch identity: default, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_Q8_1_VERIFY=0`,
`GGML_CUDA_FUSE_GDN_CONV_VERIFY=0`, `GGML_CUDA_FUSE_CPY_BATCH=0` and all three off give the same per-`W`
hashes in every cell above; greedy text at 400 tokens is identical for `none` and `draft-mtp n3` (27B
prose `0f57c09e9ce2`, 35B-A3B prose `4111be939ff4`, 27B code `cfcc349aaa5a`); prefill-logit is mean KLD
`-0.000000` / same-top-p `100.000 %`; and acceptance does not move (R axis `0.52065`, acc per pos
(0.722, 0.500, 0.340)).  RDNA3_5 stays excluded (`0x1150` is outside `GGML_CUDA_CC_IS_RDNA3_0`) and was
verified inert on gfx1151 (same `W=1..8` hashes as r94 and as all-off, no `cpy_batch` run, no
`GDN_CONV_DIRECT` for the verify band).  **gfx1101-gfx1102 are inside the predicate but are not
explicitly validated**, and RDNA3_0 multi-device is an accepted open gap (`TODO.md` #79,
`archive/work/rdna3-verify-fusions/RESOLUTION.md`).

## 12. The guarantee depends on the KV-cache type

| K/V (same type) | status |
|---|---|
| f16, bf16 | pure — the reference configuration |
| q8_0, q4_0 | **were impure** (`W=1,2` != `W=3..8`) — fixed by §14 |
| q4_1, q5_0, q5_1, iq4_nl | pure, but through the generic F16-staging fallback (~3.4x slower at the time) |

**Rule:** the impure set was exactly the two types with a *fast native* both-quantized FA path, so this is
a **trade, not an oversight** — any future native path must be width-invariant by construction.

## 13. qwen4exp's hyper-connection band is `1 <= nt <= 8`

`HC_MIX` / `HC_COMBINE` were gated to a single-token batch, so decode and verify took different arithmetic
(98 dispatches at `W=1`, **0** at `W>=2`).  The whole decode/verify band (`HC_FUSED_MAX_TOKENS`) now runs
the fused ops with the token index on `blockIdx.y`.  **Caveat:** a `<= 8`-token *prefill* chunk takes the
fused path too — indistinguishable from a verify batch, which is the point.

## 14. F1: the FA chooser spanned two kernel families inside the band

§12's `q8_0`/`q4_0` impurity was `ggml_cuda_get_best_fattn_kernel()` returning **VEC** for `n_q <= 2` with a
quantized K/V and **TILE** from `n_q = 3`.  Both VEC conditions sit inside the band, so the branch is
deleted and the band is TILE throughout.  Measured (3x gfx1201): 4B q8_0 `W=1..8` all `31a0c1bace68` (1 GPU),
`abebfb93` (2-GPU tensor), `7fe106f5` (3-GPU); 27B q8_0 KV `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7` = `3537bc2b36be`.
Every new value equals that config's **previous verify** value, so only `W = 1,2` moved: MTP is
bit-unchanged and the cost is decode-only (-0.9 % 4B / -0.5 % 27B tg128).

**F3 reframing:** §12's "no native FA kernel" explanation is wrong in detail — `q4_1`/`q5_0`/`q5_1`/
`iq4_nl` are rejected by `ggml_cuda_fattn_kv_type_supported()` unless `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS`, so
attention takes the generic fallback: width-invariant by construction, hence pure.

**Harness lesson:** apply backspaces, strip the banner and the `[ Prompt: … ]` footer before hashing
`llama-cli` output, and always run a control that must agree.

## 15. F2 cause 2: upstream's per-type mmvq caps were numeric boundaries inside the band

`get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch_*` sizes `mul_mat_vec_q_moe`'s launch bound *and* chooses mmvq vs MMQ, and the two
reduce in different orders — so every cap boundary inside the band is a numeric boundary.  (It is a
graph-identical bug: the same node counts at `W=4` and `W=5`; the mixed-quant UD file is what exposes it.)
**Fix:** floor the cap at `MMVQ_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` for every AMD lookup and size the MoE kernel's launch bound
at the band.  Every call site is `MUL_MAT_ID`-only, so dense models cannot be affected.  Result: `W=1..8`
one hash per split (each equal to that split's pre-fix `W=1` value), `n_max 7` **+16-18 %**, and
`llama-batched-bench` `pl=5..8` **+14-26 %** — upstream's caps were costing exactly the speculative-verify
widths on RDNA4.

## 16. Cause 3: the QSA dense decode arm was `n_tokens == 1`

The indexer has three arms (dense+store below the selection width, the dense arch policy, the sparse top-k
selection) and arm 2 was gated on `n_tokens == 1`.  From the first decode graph (`n_kv = 2304 > 2051`)
`--spec-type none` took the dense arm and `draft-mtp` took the sparse one — the same state, two attention
regimes, purely from the batch width.  **Fix:** `QSA_DECODE_BAND = 8` (arm 2 takes `n_tokens <= band`);
prefill keeps the sparse arm.  `plain == n_max 3 == n_max 7` = `804de0576868`.  The band became
depth-derived in §32.

## 17. The MoE shared-expert epilogue is band-uniform too

The fused down epilogue was gated decode-only, with an in-code note that the fused gate reduction does not
reproduce the standalone `mmvq` order.  **Fix:** the kernels are token-generic (one warp per token; one
block per `(output row, token)`) and the whole band takes the fused path with **`nwarps` pinned to the
single-token value** — `calc_nwarps` returns 4 for `ncols_dst 1..4` but 2 for `5..8`, and `nwarps` sets
`blocks_per_iter`, i.e. the reduction order.  `W = 1,2,3,4,8` all `ac8825358d9adfda`;
`GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_SHEXP_DOWN_GATE=1` gives the uniform unfused reference.  The band's `pl=8` cost was
repaid structurally in §24.

## 18. The QSA sparse gfx1151 width-dependences did not reproduce

Re-measured with the current delivery, neither recorded width-dependence holds: the fused indexer score is
byte-identical to the per-op chain, and the residual split was **§25's** RDNA3_5 single-token mmvq fusion
(reproduced exactly with `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1`).  Default gfx1151 configs are
pure (dense decode on every KV type; deep sparse decode at ~74K on f16 and q8_0).  The remaining forced-arm
q8_0 shallow residual was root-caused to (a) the `embeddings_nextn` export deferral (§28) and (b) the
flattened indexer score crossing `MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (§29) — both fixed, gfx1151 re-validated
2026-09-12 (14).

## 19. Purity first: the measured trade

**A purity fix may cost a few percent of raw non-MTP throughput.  That is not a gate failure.**  The
asymmetry is structural: the draft's proposals *are* decode steps, so any arithmetic difference between
decode and verify shows up as draft-vs-verify disagreement, and lost acceptance costs a multiple of
whatever the "faster" path saved.

* the shared-expert band fix (§17) cost ~2.4 % at `pl=8` and **raised MoE acceptance 0.51 → 0.817**
  (167.3 t/s vs plain 96.9, **+73 %**);
* the QSA decode-arm fix (§16) cost ~1.5-2 % at `pl=5/6` and gave **+28 %** (63.9 vs 50.1 t/s).

**Gate for a purity fix:**

1. **correctness** — `plain == draft-mtp` across the whole band (`n_max <= 7`) on every supported KV type,
   or a documented reason why the regime is unreachable by default;
2. **MTP** — pos-1 acceptance >= ~0.45 and `draft-mtp` >= `plain` at the default depth (`n_max 3`); a fixed
   high depth may lose (that is over-drafting, not a regression);
3. **perf** — no hard requirement at the wide verify widths: record the delta, file the optimisation
   follow-up, land the purity fix first, and prefer the side whose arithmetic is the **decode** side.

**Corollary:** a "win" measured before a purity fix may have been measured with a width-dependent path.

**Addendum (2026-10-20, r95) — admitting an architecture to a band is a purity claim, so it is gated at
the widths.**  Extending the verify-band fusions to RDNA3_0 (PR #192 + PR #193) is not a perf-tuning
change: it decides *which arithmetic the RDNA3_0 verify batch runs*, so the deliverable evidence is the
`W = 1..8` probe, not a throughput number.  The design that made it safe is that every fusion was
already **bit-identical to the path it replaces** — the Q8_1 pre-quantize kernels write the values
`quantize_q8_1` writes, the GDN conv keeps its 4-tap order and `silu` with the snapshot tail still
materialised, and the batched CPY copies in `ggml_cpy`'s flat order — so no kernel had to change, only
the arch predicate.  Gate any future arch admission the same way: one predicate, the probe on every
model class the band reaches, `none == draft-mtp`, and the same-binary kill-switch identity.  Numbers
and hashes: §11; record `archive/work/rdna3-verify-fusions/RESOLUTION.md`.

**Addendum (2026-10-20, r93) — a shape-scoped launch parameter must be forwarded to every kernel that
reproduces that launch.**  The fused single-token kernels (`ssm_gate_beta`, `ssm_conv_l2_gatebeta`,
`shexp_down_gate`, the `rms_norm`→Q8_1 fold, the gate/bias folds) each *replace* a dense mmvq weight
launch, so they must call the same selector (`calc_nwarps_weight(type, ncols, table, long_k, <row scope>)`).
A scope applied to the plain launch but not the fused one runs `W=1` at one warp count and `W=2..8` at
another (measured: 35B-A3B 0.150, gemma-26B **3.35** on the width probe).  The scope was the `!has_fusion`
exclusion in the `archive/work/nwarps/` candidate — not a missing reduction-mapping derivation.  The host
must compute the value once and pass it to both the launch dims and the kernel template (§20).

## 20. A newly enabled KV-cache type is a new kernel family

Each newly reachable (K,V) diagonal gets its own `W = 1..8` sweep on every split, its own
`plain == draft-mtp` text gate, its own MTP acceptance reading, and (per §21) the oracle and perplexity
comparison.

* **On gfx1201 the enabled types are band-uniform by construction** — a quantized cache always takes TILE
  with the launcher's F16 staging (that is F1, §14).  The new diagonal instances exist for the other
  backends and for predicate consistency.
* **A type the model's *other* attention ops cannot read is a correctness trap.**  qwen4exp + a quantized
  cache + `-sm tensor` aborted in the meta splitter because the graph kept building the fused sparse QSA
  op for a type its kernel cannot read, so that op was never split.  Block 14 now takes the dense masked
  path when the cache type is not QSA-native.  When a type is enabled for one op, check **every** op that
  consumes the cache, in every split mode.

## 21. A shared staging tile makes a block head-homogeneous

The QSA kernel gives one block up to `QSA_MAX_HEADS = 16` query heads (one warp each) and stages **one**
K/V tile for all of them, with each thread adding *its own head's* K/V offset.  That is only valid while
every q-head in the block maps to the same K/V head.  qwen4exp is 24 q-heads / 2 kv-heads = **gqa 12 < 16**,
so heads 12..15 wrote the *second* K/V head's rows into the same smem slots.  The chunking is now
`min(QSA_MAX_HEADS, gqa_ratio)`.

**The general rule:** whenever several heads/sequences/rows share one staged buffer, the block's work
partition must be homogeneous in every index that the *staging* reads but the *compute* does not re-apply.

**Why nothing caught it:**

1. **Width purity cannot see it** — the bug is perfectly width-uniform (every width takes the same wrong
   rows).  An internal consistency gate can prove widths agree with *each other*, never that they agree
   with the definition of the op.
2. **The probe was blind to the op** — `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_QSA` is only built above the indexer selection
   width (`indexer_top_k + r - 1` = 2051) and the probe's `n_ctx` is 2048.  Run the QSA gate with
   `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_SHORTCUT=0 LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_DECODE_UNTIL=0`.
3. **MTP acceptance points the wrong way** — draft and target run the same wrong attention, so the
   corrupted pair is self-consistent and accepts *more* (0.65 vs 0.49).  Acceptance is a quality signal
   only when both sides are known-good.
4. **What does catch it:** the **CPU reference** (`test_flash_attn_qsa`, 18 cases across KV types, cache
   widths, head sizes and `n_tps` — old kernel NMSE ~1.0, fixed < 5e-4) and the **dense masked path as an
   oracle** (PPL 7.3269 old vs 6.5306 dense; fixed 6.5267).  Keep the oracle in the test suite.

## 22. `iq4_nl`: the type is not the only thing an enablement touches

`iq4_nl` is a first-class FA cache type; the full checklist (§20) ran: pure everywhere, text
`acd18ad2d55c` (tensor) / `a38a6e2d8efa` (layer), MTP pos-1 0.757, `FLASH_ATTN_QSA` 22/22.

Three lessons that generalise:

* **A type rejected by the FA probe hides *unreachable code paths*.**  The non-contiguous staging
  converter never listed `iq4_nl`, and `launch_fattn` calls it unconditionally when K/V is a *view* — so
  the enablement turned a dormant `nullptr` into a null-pointer call on the first token (found by
  `test-backend-ops -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT`, whose 336 `iq4_nl` cases had only ever been skipped).  When a
  predicate starts accepting a type, assume its coverage in every consumer is stale.
* **"The type is 3.4x slower" is a statement about the pre-state, not the type** — that number was the
  no-FA path; with FA it is within 2 % of f16 on dense models.  Record the pre-state *with the regime*.
* **A type-specific cost can live outside the type's kernels** — the qwen4exp `iq4_nl` prefill delta is
  host/launch-side (`rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` + a full-graph dump; identical kernel sums and an identical
  1010-node graph).  Prove it with a profile before optimising.

## 23. A silently dead chain: the shadowed variable

An *outer* `ggml_tensor * kq_mask_top_k = nullptr;` was shadowed by a new local inside the mask chain, so
the dense masked arm attended with **no mask at all** (random-text PPL `1.0205` broken vs `19.0589`
healthy; qwen4exp `1.0558` vs `6.49-6.55`).

1. **A graph tensor with no consumer is silently dropped** — the chain was unreachable from the output, so
   it was never emitted, the packed mask was never allocated, and its `if (self_kq_mask->buffer)` fill guard
   skipped filling it.  "Created in the graph" proves nothing about being *filled*.
2. **When an executed-graph dump is *missing* nodes, suspect the graph builder, not the allocator.**
3. **`-Wshadow` would have caught this class outright** (see `archive/work/shadow-warnings/`).
4. **The leak instrument to reach for first is random text** — a model that can see the target predicts
   even noise; repetitive text scores ≈1 in a healthy build too.

## 24. The cost of a band amendment can be structural, not arithmetic

The §17 amendment's `pl=8` −2.4 % was the *launch shape* (`grid = (nrows, ncols)`, one block per
(output row, token): the down-weight row re-read per token and both barriers, the cross-warp reduction and
the epilogue duplicated per token), not the invariant.  A `ncols_dst`-templated kernel with the token loop
inside the k-block loop made it **+3.1 %** with zero numerical change.

1. **Band-uniformity constrains the arithmetic, not the launch shape.**  When a band fix costs a few
   percent, ask whether the cost is the *invariant* or the *shape* it was implemented with.
2. **The strongest control for "this changes nothing" is two binaries, not one hash** — keep both
   `libggml-hip.so` builds of the tip and swap them (`tools/sobench.sh`), so the two builds agree *with
   each other* at every gate.
3. **A no-op at the gate config can still be a large wall-clock win** — measure both.
4. **Check the premise of your own control** — the assumed "plain" reference model did take the RDNA4
   routed-compact MMQ dispatch (`rocprofv3`: 480 launches per `pp512`/`ub512`), so the usable control was
   the dispatch's *reach*, not the model choice.

## 25. The RDNA3_5 single-token-only mmvq fusions are not decode/verify bit-identical

Two fusions route `W=1` through kernels that do not reproduce the standalone arithmetic: the **dense
gate+up+GLU** fusion (`mmvq.cu` restricts fusion to `ncols_dst == 1`) and the **MoE weighted-down tail**
(RDNA3_5-only, single-token by shape fingerprint).  Measured (qwen4exp UD-IQ4_XS, f16, gfx1151):

| config | `W=1` | `W=8` |
|---|---|---|
| default | `8abc6206d1e80709` | `453eaa618738273d` |
| `GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_WEIGHTED_DOWN=1` | `8d036a7b8c8a5ce5` | `453eaa618738273d` |
| dense-GLU fusion disabled | `969940599c5426e9` | `453eaa618738273d` |
| **both disabled** | **`453eaa618738273d`** | **`453eaa618738273d`** |

**Fix:** skip both on RDNA3_5 unless `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_RDNA3_5_SINGLE_TOKEN_FUSIONS=1` (A/B).  Post-fix
`W = 1,2,4,8` is one hash per config (qwen4exp f16 `453eaa61`, q8_0 `113696b9`, MoE `18999a78`); the
gfx1201 path is untouched.  **Cost** ≈ −0.9 % `tg128` on qwen4exp, prefill flat (§19's trade).  The
follow-up that would restore it: make the fused `ncols_dst == 1` kernel reproduce the standalone reduction
instead of skipping the fusion.

**Scope:** this is *within* the 8-wide band — it broke draft-vs-verify purity at `n_max <= 7`.

## 26. A regime policy is only pure if the band takes one arm — including the prefill half

**An arm may only be selected from state that is identical for every graph computing the same sequence
position: the `n_tokens` *band* (`<= QSA_DECODE_BAND` vs above) and `n_kv`.**  The prefill arm is defined
as `n_tokens > band && n_kv < threshold`, disjoint from the decode arm by construction.  An arm gated on
`n_tokens == 1` is what broke it in §§16/32.

**The prefill arm ships disabled, and that is its purity guarantee:** `LLAMA_QSA_DENSE_PREFILL_UNTIL`
defaults to `0` = QSA prefill always (the documented arch policy), so the delivered default selects one
arm at every depth and no reference hash moves.  Verified byte-identical to the pre-amendment build
(f16 `0fc4910d5824`, q8_0 `e8f8bba3942b` on gfx1151).

Corollaries if it is ever enabled: a regime knob is a quality knob and the default is the arbiter; a
self-limiting arm cannot lose at depth (long prefill keeps the faster sparse chunks).

## 27. A rollback bound is a purity bound

Only the **sequential** GDN kernel writes the `K = n_rs_seq + 1` snapshot planes; the whole-batch chunked
kernel writes slot 0 only, so it is safe for a batch only if that batch is never rolled back into.  The
original constant ("a batch longer than `max(K, 16)` cannot be a verify batch") was false for ngram-style
long drafts, so the bound now comes from the widest speculator draft:
`n_rs_batch = common_speculative_n_max() + 1`, consumed as
`GDN_CHUNKED_MIN_TOKENS = max(K > 16 ? K : 16, n_rs_batch)`.  A whole-batch rollback also needs a
**pre-batch plane** (`0 < n_tokens < K`), which the graph copies into slot `n_tokens`.

**Current state (r91, 2026-10-19).**  The bound is **enforced, not observed**: `common` sets
`cparams.n_rs_batch = common_speculative_n_max() + 1` over **every** speculator type (draft
simple/mtp/adaptive/eagle3/dflash/dspark *and* ngram simple/map/mod/cache, so ngram-mod's default n_max 64
gives 65), `llama_context` floors it at `n_rs_seq + 1`, and the GDN op's threshold is floored at it — so a
speculative verify batch can never take the chunked path.  The campaign's "ngram is an exposure" claim was
wrong.  The remaining source of a partial rollback is a **non-speculator** rewind into a prefill batch
(server cancel / `--cache-reuse`), which block 10's fixed-`D` sequential tail covers: the last
`D = max(K>16?K:16, n_rs_batch)` tokens of a single-sequence prefill batch run the sequential kernel in the
same launch (`GGML_CUDA_GDN_TAIL=0` is the A/B; probe NMSE 0.65 → 1e-3).  The **issue-#131 warning** was a
stale per-sequence tracker entry (block 03 now folds every ubatch in).  Record:
`archive/work/rs-rollback-boundary/RESOLUTION.md`.

**Rules:** every batch that can be rolled back into must run the kernel that writes the snapshots it will
read; derive the bound from the speculator, not from the snapshot depth; keep the guard as a real
invariant check.

## 28. An export-only tail must not redefine the logits path

An extra graph output (the MTP draft's `t_h_nextn`) may add work but must not move the arithmetic of the
*logits* path.  The trap: an unmasked export needs a hidden row for **every** token, so the last layer's
output-row gather was deferred until after the export was taken — and the last-layer tail then ran on the
full prefill ubatch instead of the gathered rows, shifting the prefill's last-position logits by a ULP
(`ad3acaa7…` vs `b624a79f…`).

**Fix (block 10):** always gather the output rows before the tail (exactly what `--spec-type none` does)
and build a **second, full-row tail** whose only consumer is `t_h_nextn`, only when the export is on and
the chunk drops rows.  It must be expanded explicitly (`ggml_build_forward_expand`) — `ggml_set_output()`
alone does not add a tensor to the graph.

**Generalise:** when a graph gains an output read by a different consumer, check the batch width of every
node the logits traverse, and prefer "compute the logits path exactly as the plain arm does, then compute
the export separately".

## 29. A flattened batch is not a token count

The "keep a verify batch on the MMVF family" guard keys on the matmul's `ne11`, which is the token count
only while N is the token count.  The QSA indexer score carries the **indexer heads** in N, so its `ne11`
is `4 * n_tps`: from `n_tps = 3` decode stayed on MMVF (`ne11 = 4`) while the verify batch fell to MMF
(`ne11 = 12`), and the families accumulate differently.

**Signature:** bit-identical to decode for many steps, then one divergence at a fixed position (a
selection flip, not drift); the greedy text may stay equal, so only a per-step logits replay (`mstep`)
sees it.

**Fix (block 10):** `MMVF_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_FLAT` (`= 32`) with `mul_mat_vec_f` instantiated for
`ncols_dst` 9..32.  **Rule:** the band guard's "batch size" must be the **maximum flattened N** the op can
produce in the band; audit any matmul whose N is a per-token × per-head/expert/group product.

## 30. A support predicate decides the *layout*, and the layout decides an address-gated fusion

A CUDA `GET_ROWS` predicate required `ne[0] % QK_K == 0`, so a 128-wide `iq4_nl` indexer-key gather was
rejected and that node ran on the CPU (13 host round trips per prefill graph, GPU busy/span 0.62 vs 0.96).
Widening it re-addressed the whole compute buffer, and the MoE-router `topk_moe` fusion is selected by
**buffer-address overlap** — so the model output moved (`c0d44c479ee1` → `14a1a3f257f4`) even though the
moved op itself is bit-exact.

**Rules:** a support predicate is a correctness surface for *layout*, not only for reachability — when you
widen one, re-run the full gate set, the observable can move in a *different* op.  And an
address-overlap-driven fusion whose arithmetic is not bit-identical makes the output allocation-dependent
(pre-existing upstream behaviour; the delivery's own invariants are unaffected because coverage is
width-uniform within a config).

**Instrument:** `GGML_SCHED_DEBUG=1` prints the per-graph split count, `=2` the per-node backend — cheaper
than a profiler for "which op left the GPU".  Both need **`-lv 5`** (`-lv 4` prints nothing).

## 31. An address-selected fusion must be bit-identical to the path it replaces

The fused MoE router (`ggml_cuda_op_topk_moe`) is selected by buffer-address overlap but was **not**
bit-identical to the generic `soft_max → argsort → get_rows → norm` chain, so the output was a function of
the allocation plan.  Three fixes make it transparent:

* **softmax reduction order** — the generic path's per-"virtual warp" butterfly then cross-warp phase, not
  one flat butterfly over `l + i*32` (36 % of random 512-value rows differed by up to 2.4e-7 relative);
* **normalization** — accumulate in `reduce_rows_f32` order and **divide**, not multiply by `1/sum`;
* **argsort tie-break** — the generic CUDA bitonic sort is non-stable; the fused argmax broke ties by
  smaller index and CUB's sort is stable.  The bitonic comparator now breaks ties by index (ties are real:
  4 occurred in one qwen4exp run).

**Rules:** a fusion selected by memory addresses must be numerically transparent; a non-stable sort is a
latent fusion hazard; verify with the kill-switch (`fused == GGML_CUDA_DISABLE_TOPK_MOE_FUSION=1` for every
native KV type on both split modes), not just `plain == draft-mtp` (both paths are internally width-uniform).

## 32. A decode/verify band policy must scale with the configured draft depth

`QSA_DECODE_BAND = 8` was a fixed constant while the verify width is `n_max + 1`.  Once the clamp moved
from 7 to 15, a depth-8..15 verify became a 9..16-token batch: above the indexer selection width
(`indexer_top_k + r - 1` = 2051) the W=1 decode took the dense arm and the verify fell to sparse — the
"diverges after ~2051 tokens" qwen4exp depth-15 bug.

| build | `W = 1..8` | `W = 9..16` |
|---|---|---|
| pre-fix | `643a8166d8dad677` | `1354757f9daf03db` (= the forced-sparse hash) |
| post-fix | `643a8166d8dad677` | `05be2f7f30dbc426` (the dense arm) |

**Fix:** `qsa_decode_band = max(QSA_DECODE_BAND, cparams.n_rs_batch)`; default configs leave the band at 8
and are byte-identical to the pre-amendment build.

**Rules:** derive a band constant from the quantity it is matching; a bug that only fires past a regime
threshold needs the threshold crossed in the test (the 1..8 probe was green because below 2051 the shortcut
arm covers every width); a depth-policy change re-runs the width matrix for every model family it touches.

## 33. A gate must run the content the axis intends, long enough to reach steady state

The four-axis adaptive-MTP gate was first run with the model's default reasoning mode at `-n 256`, which
invalidated it in both directions: the "code" axis never reached code (it measured the thinking trace,
acceptance 0.56 instead of 0.89-0.92), and `-n 256` measures warm-up, not the mode (code axis −5 % at 256
vs **+28 %** at 3000 — the ranking inverted).  Purity above `n_max 7` is a probabilistic near-tie property,
so it needs enough tokens to hit one.

**Rules:** run the gate at a length matching the workload (`-n 3000`, `-n 2000` floor); pin the content
mode (`--reasoning off` for P/C/K, `on` for R); a spot test that passes is not evidence a long run passes.

## 34. A K/V staging policy is a decode-depth policy

The V4/V5 native-staging arms were documented as a *memory* feature with decode "unaffected".  For a
quantized K/V the F16 staging pass is a **whole-cache conversion that runs every decode step and scales
with `n_kv`** — so the staging source is a decode-depth policy and can be the load margin: 27B q8_0
`tg64` d65536 18.92 → **23.29 t/s** for ~1.2 % prefill, and the same ~744 MiB scratch was the **260 MiB**
the draft context was short at `-c 196608`.

**Rules:** a native staging arm must reproduce the launcher's conversion bit-for-bit (same-seed text, then
the width matrix, then acceptance); the policy is per type class (native is the default for sub-F16 quants,
bf16's MMA-scratch arm stays opt-in; `GGML_CUDA_FA_KV_NATIVE` is three-state: unset = auto, 1 = force on,
0 = force staging); a memory win can be a load-time win — measure the *total* budget, not the failing
allocation.

## 35. A prefill kernel config must be arch- and split-keyed

Two globals were wrong: the `ncols=64` row was a gfx1151 "halo row" applied on gfx1201 too (delivery
prefill slope ~51 % steeper than stock, crossing at ~64K), and `ncols2` is a compute-vs-bandwidth trade —
a whole card is compute-bound and prefers a divisor of the GQA ratio, a tensor split is per-GPU
bandwidth-bound and prefers the wider value.

**Rules:** key the config on the arch with host/device agreement; treat the split regime as a first-class
axis and pass it explicitly (`ggml_set_fa_tensor_parallel`, set from `split_mode() == TENSOR &&
n_cuda_dev > 1` — `llama_model::n_devices()` is **1** under tensor split, so count CUDA sub-devices);
`op_params` is not a reliable channel (the graph copy loses it); `-sm tensor` hides single-card
regressions, so screen with a `t = a + b*n` slope fit **and** measure one card.

## 36. §14's `W=1..8` purity is a measured claim — relax it for the coarse quants

The kernel-family part holds (on AMD the whole band is TILE and the KV split is width-invariant).  What
remains is a **logits-level band edge** between `n_q = 1` and `n_q >= 2` that shows up only as a
rounding-boundary lottery (measured edges: bf16 at P=200, q4_0 at P=224/256, q4_1 at P=200 on the 4B).
At the measured edge the argmax is unchanged and the delta is 0.014-0.064 against a top-2 margin of 2.2-2.7,
i.e. one to two orders below the error the coarse cache itself imposes.  Pre-existing and independent of
the native arms; the launcher dump shows the reduction structure is identical at every width, so the
cause is in the FA path's *values* (leading hypothesis: the mask-derived KV support range), not proven.

**Decision (maintainer, 2026-09-15): won't fix.**  The reward is unmeasurable (greedy token never moved,
acceptance bit-identical), and the fix adds work to the latency-critical single-token width.  The trigger
to revisit is an **argmax change** (a quality event); a hash change with a 2.2+ margin is not one.

**Doctrine, tiered by coherence:**

* **f16 / bf16 / q8_0** — the guaranteed contract is a **text/acceptance** one, and it is *tested*: the
  greedy text is bit-identical across the band (`plain == draft-mtp` for `n_max <= 7`, acceptance
  unchanged).  Logits-level purity held at every (prompt, P) tested **except bf16 at P=200 on the 4B**.
* **q4_0 / q4_1 / q5_0 / q5_1 / iq4_nl** — a good-faith effort: values bit-identical to the reference
  conversion and a uniform kernel family, but **no logits-level promise**; a near-tie may flip, argmax
  stays.  The cache is already the dominant long-context loss at these quantizations, and every retrofit
  measured cost 0.5-9 % on the axis it touched.  Use f16/bf16/q8_0 when you need long-context coherence.

## 37. A fully-masked KV group is an exact no-op

A KV group whose kq-mask entries are all `-INF` contributes exact zeros and leaves `KQ_max`/`KQ_rowsum`/
`VKQ` unchanged, so skipping it is **bit-identical**.  `GGML_CUDA_FA_MASK_SKIP` (default on) is gated on
`Q->ne[1] > 8` for the packed mask (and the derived `cell_pos` path is already prefill-only), so the
decode/verify band's round-robin KV split and the width-purity invariants are untouched.

**Why it is needed:** a `--kv-unified` cache puts the other slots' fully-masked interior cells inside the
attention range, and `flash_attn_mask_to_KV_max` only trims the tail (and is not even launched at `-ub
512`).  **The gate:** the classification must be per (Q stream, query tile, 256-cell group) on the packed
path (continuous batching mixes sequences in a ubatch) and batch-wide on the derived path.  `FLASH_ATTN_EXT`
**6354/6354**, `-kvu` B=4 prefill +22 % (MMA) / +72 % (tile), acceptance and text byte-identical.

## 38. The guarantee is scoped to a fixed batch; `--kv-unified` serving is not deterministic

The bit-identity invariants hold for a **fixed** batch.  They do not promise that a *concurrent server* is
run-to-run deterministic, and it is not — the batch composition changes the kernel and reduction order.
It reproduces on **one GPU** with no all-reduce, so it is not the hybrid AR or `-sm tensor`; sequential
requests on the same server are byte-identical.

**The exact rule (closed 2026-10-19):** it is **unified KV** specifically.  A sequence's result is a function
of its KV cells' tile indices **modulo the per-launch KV-split period** (`pb × nbatch_fa`; `pb` is
`parallel_blocks` for the tile kernel, derived from the *shared* view length, and the fixed band `P`
otherwise).  A shift by exactly one period is bit-identical; any smaller shift can flip a near-tie.
Under `--kv-unified` every new **decode** token takes the shared head, so the residue follows the
co-resident session's allocation history.  Measured on r91 (gfx1151): period 960 cells on the 4B, 1920 on
35B-A3B, both verified bit-identical under a one-period shift.  It reproduces on unmodified upstream, so
it is upstream-inherent.  The cheap fix (chunk sessions by band width / align prompt starts) is
**refuted** — the quantum is the period, not the tile.  A sufficient fix (period-granular per-sequence cell
ownership, ~30-38 MiB per live session on the tested models) is an upstream allocator redesign with no
throughput win and is deliberately not implemented.

**Consequence:** **use `--no-kv-unified` when strict reproducibility is required**; never use a
concurrent-server text hash as a purity gate or a bisection oracle.  The reporter's separate HIP-graphs
start-to-start flip (surviving `--no-kv-unified`) is **not** this root, was not reproduced on Linux, and is
tracked as TODO #67.  Record:
`archive/work/kv-cell-offset-nondeterminism/RESOLUTION.md`.

## 39. A decode-only fusion must match the standalone launch it replaces

A fusion that fires only in one width of the band (here `ne[1] == 1`) must reproduce the arithmetic of the
standalone kernel at that width, or the band is not width-uniform.  Block 08's `ssm_gate_beta` fused the
qwen35moe alpha/beta Q8_0 projections at `ne[1] == 1` but kept plain `calc_nwarps()` (1 warp) while the
standalone dense weight launch uses `calc_nwarps_weight()` (8 warps for Q8_0 with `K < 4096`) — so `W=1` and
`W>=2` reduced K with different warp counts.  Symptom: 35B-A3B `-ncmoe 99` `none = 6744006631df` vs
`n3 = 431bbf3a1605`, diverging ~200 tokens in.

**Fix:** select `calc_nwarps_weight(GGML_TYPE_Q8_0, 1, table, long_k = ne[0] >= 4096)` — exactly the
standalone selector; a no-op for `K >= 4096`.  `none == n1 == n3 == n7 == 431bbf3a1605`, acceptance
unchanged.

**Rule:** any new decode/verify fusion whose matcher has a width condition (`ne[1] == 1`, `ne[2] == 1`,
`n_tokens == 1`) must either be bit-identical to its unfused chain at that width (preferred) or serve the
whole band (`shexp_down_gate`).  A `ne[1] == 1` fusion that does neither is a latent width-impurity
everywhere it fires.

## 39b. The MoE expert-cache band follows the routed MMVQ band

(Originally mis-numbered `§39`.)  The cache took over a routed `MUL_MAT_ID` only for `<= 8` tokens, but the
cache serves such a batch only through the routed-expert **MMVQ** kernel, and since the extended routed
band landed that kernel serves **16** columns on RDNA4 — so 12-16-token verify batches were stranded on
the host path with the arena unused.

**Fix:** the band is `moe_cache_max_tok_dev(device)`, the narrowest `get_mmvq_mmid_max_batch` over the
device's quantized types (never below 8): **16 on RDNA4**, 8 on RDNA3 (where the 16-wide band is incorrect
on gfx1100) and NVIDIA.  It has a single owner through a `moe_cache_band` backend iface hook, so the
scheduler's band decisions and the Meta `moe_cache_update` cannot disagree.  `GGML_MOE_CACHE_MAX_TOK=8`
restores the old band.

**Purity:** nothing changes inside `n_max <= 7` (`none == draft-mtp n7` byte-identical to pre-r31), and at
the newly served widths (9-16) the arithmetic is the same routed MMVQ kernel all-VRAM already used, so the
band-16 cache path is bit-identical to all-VRAM at `n_max 8`.

## 40. A thread count is a scheduling parameter, not a numerical one

The CPU backend's op decomposition never lets the thread count change a result — every output element is
reduced by exactly one thread — so narrowing or widening the pool changes *when* work happens, not *how* it
adds up.  The r19 offloaded-MoE decode cap is byte-identical at `-t 1/8/12/16`, with
`GGML_CPU_MOE_OFFLOAD_THREADS=0/12`, with `GGML_CPU_DISABLE_TINY_GRAPH_SINGLE_THREAD=1` and under
`--cpu-mask`.

**Rule:** a change that only selects a thread count (graph, backend or op) is a perf change and needs no
purity re-run.  A change that moves a reduction boundary, a `vec_dot`, or a K-split *inside* an op does.
State which one a patch is before calling it purity-neutral.  (§39's `calc_nwarps_weight` is the contrast.)

## 40b. A reserve/measure graph must match its memory context's stream count

(Originally mis-numbered `§40`.)  `build_attn_mha` splits the query by the cache's stream dim
(`n_stream = k->ne[3]`) and `ggml_flash_attn_ext` asserts `q->ne[3] == k->ne[3]`; a graph built against a
memory context whose stream count differs cannot be made valid (the query view truncates, the attention
output has zero tokens).

**Fix:** the TODO #42 post-prefill re-reserve passed a hard-coded `n_seqs = 1` while holding the current
ubatch's context, so a multi-sequence decode reserved a 1-sequence graph and `llama-batched-bench -npl 4`
aborted.  It now uses `max(1, ubatch.n_seqs)`.  Single-sequence (MTP) reserves are unaffected.

## 41. A runtime, address-selected fusion is a cross-process purity risk; a compile-time one is not

Reproduced at the logits level (27B Q6_K, P=256, W=1 row-0): the only lever on the reporter's per-start
flip was the **address-overlap-gated fusion subset**, specifically the upstream `ROPE → VIEW → SET_ROWS`
fusion (disabling just it reproduced the all-fusions-off hash; disabling its sibling did not).  The
arithmetic was then separated from the layout side-effect: a canonicalised per-graph allocation dump is
byte-identical between the configs, both instantiations compute the same `x0`/`x1`/`cos`/`sin` and the
same float result — but `<float,__half>` stored -0.3562 while `<float,float>` + `k_set_rows` stored
-0.3564, because clang contracts the two instantiations' multiply-adds differently and one element of the
prefill write crosses an f16 rounding boundary.  **Fixed in r25** with `#pragma clang fp contract(off)` in
`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/rope.cu` (W=1 hash `60e77916673db071` for both configs).

**The residual per-start flip is hipBLASLt solution selection in ROCm** (the F32 `ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta`
`mul_mat` at 512 prefill columns picks a per-process solution, reference pair `140231`/`140232` vs
deviating `140216`/`140217`).  It reproduces on stock upstream; this is
[ROCm/rocm-libraries#12126](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/issues/12126), workaround
`ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`.  Issue #67 is closed as external.  **See §44**: on Linux / ROCm 10.1 this is
not a rare near-tie but the *entire* residual of the `gemma4` MTP determinism item (3 logit classes in 18
starts), the differing GEMM is a different shape, and its two solutions are **not** bit-identical.

**Rule:** a per-type *compile-time* constant may move the rounding path uniformly across widths and starts;
a *runtime* selection that reads allocator addresses may not.  If a fusion's
`ggml_cuda_check_fusion_memory_ranges()` outcome can change with the allocator, its fused kernel must be
bit-identical to the chain it replaces.

## 42. A width gate is not a purity rule: extending a fused chain *down* to one token

Two r78 block-10 fusions extend an existing chain or move a launch, and both keep §39's rule:

* **ADD + `rms_norm_q8_1` at one token (PR #174).**  The matcher excluded `ne[1] <= 1` because the
  *attention* residual ADD is folded into the output projection's mmvq epilogue at one token — but the
  *FFN* residual ADD is not (its producer is not a matmul).  The fused kernel's values are the unfused
  pair's, and it is measured: same-seed text byte-identical to r77 (dense 27B `7ef45a05dcfe`, MoE 35B-A3B
  `e726a23ca0cc`, `-n 3000`, `none == draft-mtp n3`), width probe unchanged, prefill-logit unchanged.
  The lesson is the converse of §19: a band gate can be a *superset* of the shapes a fusion is safe for,
  and widening it needs its own measurement.
* **KV-rotation FWHT in the rope kernel, and the projection Q8_1 in the attention-output FWHT (PR #172).**
  Bit-identical by construction (same helper, same contraction mode; the Q8_1 write is `quantize_q8_1`'s
  own reduction under the mmvq launcher's own cache key) and measured: width probe maxdiff 0 at
  P=512/3584, Gemma4 prefill-logit **0.000000 / 100.000 %**, greedy text identical with and without
  `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1`.

**Reachability is part of the claim.**  #172 fires only for NORMAL/NEOX rope with the norm+mul+rope chain
(Gemma4, and gpt-oss-20b for the Q8_1 half); on `rope_multi` models it does nothing, so a "purity + speed"
claim from one model does not transfer.  PR #173 was rejected for r78 for exactly this reason — its matcher
cannot fire on any model here, so no correctness result about it could be produced at all.

## 43. One split holds one consumer of a staged expert table

The MoE expert cache serves a routed `MUL_MAT_ID` from the **arena**, and the arena holds the slots staged
for *one* routing.  Two `MUL_MAT_ID` consumers of the same expert weights in one split therefore cannot
both be served: the scheduler's guarded fast paths (`moe_cache_take_over`, the used-expert pruning) are
already declined when they count two consumers, but the op-level arena read is not, so the second consumer
reads the first routing's slots.  qwen4exp is the model that exposes it, because its last layer has two
consumers of the same table: the gathered logits tail and the full-row MTP export tail.

Measured on r95 (before the fix), Flash-Next GSQ-IQ3_XXS + the shared Q8_0 MTP head, 2 GPU, `-sm layer`,
`-ncmoe 10`, `draft-mtp` n-max 3, `-n 48`, seed 42, temp 0:

| arm | text | acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| plain decode (`--spec-type none`) | 172 chars `de61b9b1bed7` (the truth) | n/a |
| r95 + `draft-mtp`, 6 natural runs | 5x `de61b9b1bed7`, 1x `a2b6c01a0a19` (223 chars) | `0.00000` on the bad runs |
| r95 + the split fix (PR #186), 6 runs | 6x `de61b9b1bed7` | healthy (`0.63636`) |

The flip is driven by the **persisted MoE heat map**: pinning one captured heat-map state reproduces the
bad output 2/2, and `MOE_EXPERT_CACHE_MIB=0` restores purity, while `GGML_SCHED_DEVGATHER=0`,
`GGML_SCHED_STAGE=0` and `GGML_SCHED_STAGE_MIN_TOKENS=999999` do not.  `-sm tensor` is immune (the meta
backend has no cache gather) and 35B-A3B is immune (one consumer only).  Under `-sm tensor` the bug shows up
as throughput instead: with both consumers in one split the last layer's 1062 MiB table is copied for every
prompt chunk (Flash-Next `-ncmoe 10`, follow-up turns 645/641 ms -> 449/341 ms, bit-identical text).

**Rule:** a split may hold only **one** consumer of a cache-managed expert table.  The scheduler enforces it
by starting a new split at a second `MUL_MAT_ID` consumer of weights the current split already stages
(`ggml_backend_sched_split_graph`, r96, PR #186); the re-registration path then stages them again for that
consumer's own routing, which is ready by then.  `GGML_SCHED_MOE_DUP_SPLIT=0` restores the merged split for
A/B only.  Any future "recompute this layer's FFN on all rows" path must either get its own split the same
way or keep the table out of the cache.

**Why no gate caught it:** the failure needs a *persisted* heat map in a particular state plus `-sm layer`
plus MTP, so it is invisible to the coherence gate (which never runs `-sm layer` + MTP), to the four-axis
MTP gate (27B with no host experts, where the split fix is inert) and to the prefill-logit gate (no MTP
export in `llama-perplexity`).  The instrument that found it was a `plain == draft-mtp` text comparison on
the affected config, repeated across natural heat-map states.

## 44. A per-start hipBLASLt solution pick is not a code defect — pin it before comparing starts

**Claim.** On this box (gfx1201, Linux, **ROCm 10.1.0**) the *whole* residual run-to-run divergence of the
`gemma4 26B-A4B` + MTP config is ROCm's **hipBLASLt solution selection being random per process start**
for an untuned FP32 GEMM size — issue #67 / [ROCm/rocm-libraries#12126](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/issues/12126).
`ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` removes it.  It is **not** a switch to ship: it is the tester's determinism
control, and disabling hipBLASLt costs decode (see **Cost** below) — the delivery keeps it **enabled**.

**Which GEMM.** Exactly one hipBLASLt dispatch in the run: `m=128 n=375 k=2816`, `transA T`, `transB N`,
`f32_r`, **30 calls** (= one per target layer) — `m = 128` is Gemma4 26B-A4B's `n_expert` and `k = 2816` its
`n_embd`, so this is the F32 **MoE router** (`ffn_gate_inp`) at the one prefill width that lands in the
untuned-FP32 window (other widths take mmvf/MMQ).  `HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=160` shows `solution_index 140231`
or `140232` per process, and on *this* shape the two are **not** bit-identical: `6f6923ef36` (140231) vs
`51274cb0f2` (140232), first-draft-call top-1 **0.458 vs 0.352**.

**Numbers** (gemma4 26B-A4B Q8_0 + `mtp-gemma-4-26B-A4B`, `-ngl 99 -ncmoe 40 -sm layer --fit false
-c 16384 --spec-type draft-mtp --spec-draft-n-max 3 -n 300 -t 8 --seed 42 --temp 0 --ignore-eos`, 2 GPU,
draft-candidate-logit fingerprint, one fresh process per sample):

| arm | result |
|---|---|
| default environment, N=18 | **3 classes**: `6f6923ef36` ×12, `51274cb0f2` ×4, `10e1f21f4c` ×2 |
| `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`, N=10, `-n 300` | `6f6923ef36` **×10** |
| `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`, N=3, `-n 3000` | `19eed3da33` **×3** (904 draft calls) |
| cost on *this* config | prompt **340.1** vs 327.3 t/s, gen 93.02 (sd **0.06**) vs 91.86 (sd **1.65**) |
| cost in general | **not free**: the maintainer's wider measurements show up to **-15 % decode** with
hipBLASLt disabled (partly offset by a prefill gain — the gemma4-MTP number above).  Hence: keep hipBLASLt
**enabled** by default, set `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` only for a run that must be reproducible |

**Second call site — the GDN F32 `ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta` GEMM (2026-10-21, closes `TODO #75`).**  The
same lottery, on a different op: Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Q4_K_M, `llama-perplexity -c 512 --chunks 1 -fa on`, fresh
process per sample on **this box with ROCm 10.1.0** — **3 logit classes in 8 starts** (`3629d90733a1` x5,
`a855c2000912` x2, `6d32945460bd` x1) vs **1 class in 8/8** with `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` (`2d9ed9ce03cb`).
One hipBLASLt shape in the whole run, `A[F32 2048x32] x B[F32 2048xN] T,N` (1080 dispatches; the
`llama-cli` prefill+decode arm serves two shapes, that one and the `ffn_gate_inp` router's
`A[F32 2048x256]`, 159 dispatches total), and the class is
the TensileLite spine it picked: `MT128x64x8` / `MT64x32x32` / `MT128x128x8` -> three different logit hashes.
Mean KLD between two classes **0.003479**, same-top-p **98.431 %** — *inside* the prefill-logit gate, so the
gate cannot flag this by construction.  Also: the ordering is **stable in some configs** (`test-logits-width-
probe` was 10/10 single-valued on the same build), so a config that does not flip is no evidence about the
mechanism; and greedy text was identical 12/12 across class-varying starts — judge at the logits level.
**Cost here is nil** (35B-A3B, 1 GPU, two interleaved `llama-bench` visits): `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` measures
**+1-3 % prefill** (pp512 4749.7/4840.9 -> 4899.8/4887.2, pp2048 4804.5/4798.1 -> 4841.9/4830.3) and flat
decode (tg128 108.2/108.0 vs 107.9/108.0), and peak VRAM 21822 -> 21752 MiB.  It is the model- and
runtime-dependence of that number that makes `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0` a tester's control and not a shipping
default: on gemma4 above it is a real prefill+decode *win*, elsewhere it is the -15 % decode cost.  Removing
the dispatch instead of pinning it is `wip/hipblaslt-bypass/` (`TODO #82`).

**Its outside-slab footprint is a constant ~70 MiB (2026-10-21, measured).**  Qwen3.8-Flash-Next GSQ, 2 GPU
`-sm tensor -ncmoe 48`, `GGML_CUDA_SLAB_STATS=1`: the slab's `free_min` is 53-88 MiB higher with
`ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`, **independent of ubatch (512..8192), prompt length (602..68 262 tokens), context
(16K..131K) and model**.  It does not scale, so it is TensileLite code objects plus a small fixed arena, not a
per-call workspace (the log shows 0 / 12 / 24 / 64 KiB requested per call).  Do **not** attribute the slab's
~2 GiB headroom floor to it — that floor is the MTP draft buffer, the FA-QSA workspace, the pool high-water
mark and the model's own PLE/attention allocations.  What hipBLASLt is *worth* is model-dependent: free on
35B-A3B, **+51 % prefill** on Flash-Next (`-ub 8192`, 68 262-token prompt: 2405 vs 1595 t/s), which is why a
BF16 bypass is a performance proposition while the F32 one is a correctness win.

ROCm 10.1.0 does **not** have the fix (its `rocm-libraries` pin branched 2026-09-09); it is in
`c50ea60130f`, develop 2026-10-02, TheRock nightlies from 2026-10-06.  So this *does* reproduce on **Linux**
with 10.x — §41's "Linux / 7.14 does not reproduce it" holds for 7.14 only.

**Retraction this replaces — do not re-derive the graph story.** With the library path off, *graphs on and
graphs off land on the same single class*, so graph capture/replay was never implicated.  Every capture arm
of the r100 hunt was this lottery resolving to a particular class: "target graphs off is stable at
`8f795fbaf0`" (5/5, correlated with the graphs-off arm), "draft-only graphs off", "target 1-token graphs
off", "target verify graphs off" (a lottery), "force a fresh capture on every replay" (deterministic — so
not stale baked pointers either).  Also cleared by direct arms: the draft's input embedding is bit-identical
across classes (`h_nextn`/`pending_h` hashes of the three prompt ubatches agree exactly), and the
async-input ring is not the residual (post-`0005`: `ASYNC_INPUT_BATCH=0` is itself a stable class,
`ASYNC_INPUT=0` is still a lottery).

**Rule.**  A cross-start (fresh-process) purity, coherence or text comparison must pin the external
solution selection (`ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT=0`) or must not be used to accept/reject a code change.  A
per-start difference is not evidence about a kernel, a graph or a cache until it survives that pin.  Decode
at `n=1` is mmvf and unaffected, so the exposure is **prefill-width**: it can move a *reference* recorded in
another process, which is what happened to two "discrepancies" in the r100 handover (non-reproducible gemma4
text hashes; gen 74.9/72.8 vs the recorded 79.0/74.7).  **Do not pin it in the delivery's default
environment**: the upstream fix lands at the source, and disabling hipBLASLt costs up to -15 % decode.  The
env var is the tester's determinism switch, not a shipped default.

## 45. A split the op cannot serve locally is a refusal, not an approximation

**Claim.**  The Meta backend's per-op split-state handlers decide whether an op is **local** given how a
tensor is divided across devices.  The only splits they may accept are ones where no device **straddles the
reduction**: each device's slice along the reduction axis must be either empty or the whole thing.  A
straddling split needs a cross-device reduction that these handlers do not implement, and the honest
behaviour is a hard refusal naming that, never a "close enough" arm — a wrong split state computes part of
the result on a device whose inputs are missing, which is silent corruption, not a rounding difference.

**The three shapes that are local (r101).**

* **Per-row ops** (`NORM`, `RMS_NORM`, `GROUP_NORM`, `L2_NORM`, `SUM_ROWS`, `MEAN`, `ARGMAX`, `ARGSORT`,
  `TOP_K`): dim 0 is the reduction axis, so an axis-0 split is normally cross-device.  It is local when
  every per-device extent is empty or the **whole row** — gemma4's full-attention layers have one KV head,
  so their 512-wide K/V row lands whole on one device (`ne_per_dev = [0, 512]`, measured).  A straddle
  (`[256, 256]`) still aborts.  The elementwise companion — a split tensor times a **MIRRORED same-shape**
  operand (the per-head norm weight) — follows the split operand, because nothing is reduced and the
  mirrored operand is present in full everywhere.
* **The rotated KV cache** (`-ctk q8_0` => `n_rot_k = 512`, `llama_mul_mat_hadamard`): `rot` is
  `512x512` MIRRORED and `Kcur` is reshaped to `[n_rot_k, rows]`, so the **contraction is axis 0** of
  `src1`.  Local iff every per-device contraction extent is empty or whole **and** `out->ne[0] ==
  src1->ne[0]` (a square contraction, so each device's output slice maps 1:1 onto its contraction slice);
  the owning device computes the complete dot product because every `rot` column is available to it.
* **Flash-attention K/V** with more than one sequence in the ubatch (`n_stream > 1`: `llama-server -np > 1`,
  `llama-batched-bench -npl > 1`, `llama-perplexity --kl-divergence`): the FA cache view spans the cache's
  stream dimension, so gemma4's whole-on-one-device KV arrives split on the cache's **embd** axis instead
  of the kv-head axis.  Both mean the same thing, and the extra condition is that the **query** is
  empty-or-whole on the same devices — a device holding queries but no K/V would compute rows nothing
  serves, which is exactly the broken combination to keep refusing.

**Why this is a purity rule, not a convenience.**  Each accepted shape's alternative is an abort, so the
temptation is to accept a straddling split "since the data is all there".  It is not: with a straddle, no
device has the whole reduction, so every device produces a *partial* sum that must be reduced — a feature
this layer does not have.  Accepting it would produce coherent-looking text whose logits are wrong, the
failure class §7 and the prefill-logit gate exist to catch.

**Measured.**  gemma4 12B Q8_0 with `-sm tensor` is byte-identical to `-sm layer` (`c740be0e131a`, 143
chars) in f16 **and** rotated `-ctk/-ctv q8_0`, at 2 and 3 GPU; the rotated single-device prefill-logit
gate reproduces its recorded base to six digits (`-0.000000 / 99.990 %`), and under `-sm tensor` the
rotated arm is indistinguishable from the f16 one (`0.2041 / 86.0 %` vs `0.2134 / 86.7 %` against the
`-sm layer` reference — the ~0.21 is the tensor split's own all-reduce rounding, identical with no rotation
in the picture).  The multi-sequence fix is verified the same way: `llama-batched-bench -npp 512 -npl 1,4`
runs (3353 t/s at B=4 vs 2896 `-sm layer`), and two concurrent 400-token requests on `llama-server -np 2`
both return 200 where the process used to abort.

## 46. A tile→WMMA family switch is judged at a calibrated point, against a same-kernel control

**Claim.** The prefill-logit gate's absolute limits (mean KLD `<= 0.005`, same-top-p `>= 98 %`) decide a
change *inside* a kernel family: a quant type, a precision change, an approximate path.  A **kernel-family
switch** (the r5/r99 FA head caps, the r102 RDNA3_0 head-512 rows) does not share a reduction order with
the kernel it replaces, so its divergence is the tuning, not a defect.  Two guards make it decidable:

1. **The point must be one the model is confident about** (base PPL inside the gate's calibrated domain,
   ~6).  At a point it finds hard, *every* reordering is far outside the limits, so the number says
   nothing about the candidate.  This was the whole of the r102 "failure" (`TODO.md` #81, closed
   2026-10-21); the model there is a reasoning model on raw wikitext, 45x outside its confident range.
2. **A same-kernel control measured on the spot** — the same kernel at a different ubatch — so the
   candidate is compared with the floor of what a reordering costs there, not only with an absolute
   number.

**The measurement (gfx1100, gemma-4-26B-A4B-QAT UD-Q4_K_XL, f16 K/V, one base file per point, one base
per arm.)**

| point | base PPL | same-kernel control (`-ub 512` vs `-ub 256`) | head-256 rows vs fully tile | head-512 rows, marginal (vs the delivery without them) |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| wikitext-2 `-c 512 --chunks 40` (the default gate point) | 607 | **0.104989 / 85.000 %** | 0.044055 / 90.627 % | 0.029285 / 92.588 % |
| in-domain text `-c 512 --chunks 30` | 13.7 | 0.036654 / 93.660 % | 0.022562 / 96.000 % | 0.011303 / 97.451 % |
| in-domain text `-c 2048 --chunks 10` (`prompts/fa-family-switch-gemma4-26B-A4B.txt`) | **2.65** | 0.013962 / 97.221 % | 0.005994 / 98.324 % | **0.001778 / 98.967 %** |

So the head-512 rows **pass the absolute limits at a calibrated point** (0.00178 / 98.967 %, 2.8x inside
the KLD limit and 8x better than the same-kernel control), and at every point they are more faithful than
the head-256 rows shipped default-on since r5 — which are the bigger *total* contributor only because
there are 25 of those layers against 5.

**No row parameter moves the number** (all measured against the same bases, gfx1100, deployable binary):
an fp32 PV accumulator (`T_C_VKQ`; the one structural difference from the tile kernel's fp32 accumulator)
gave 0.030489 marginal at the wikitext point and cost **-32 %** throughput; `nbatch_fa` 64 gave 0.030865
at -19 %; `nbatch_fa` 128 (+`Q_in_reg=true`, the tile kernel's strip length) gave 0.029081 at -14 %;
`Q_in_reg=true` alone is **bit-identical** (KLD to every printed digit) at **-29 %** — the win really is
the spills and it has no accuracy effect.  The divergence is the reduction order; attribution table and
per-variant records: `archive/work/fa-rdna3-head512-purity/`.

**The op-level accuracy reference is the second, deterministic leg.**  `FA_DBG_NMSE=1 test-backend-ops -o
FLASH_ATTN_EXT` prints the NMSE each case already computes against the CPU backend, so the two families can
be compared on the model's own prefill shape (`hsk=hsv=512, nr23=[8,1], kv=32768, nb=512`): f16 5.99e-5
(WMMA) vs 5.71e-5 (tile), q8_0 2.30e-5 vs 1.64e-5, threshold 5e-4 — within a factor 1.3, neither an
accuracy regression; at nb=24/64 WMMA is 1.1-2.8x *closer* to the CPU reference.  (`FA_DBG_SEED=1` pins the
random input so the two arms are comparable; without it the test data is redrawn per run and NMSE moves by
up to 13x.)

**Rule.** For a family switch run `scripts/gate-prefill-logits.sh --family-switch` (protocol:
`benchmarks/prefill-logit-methodology.md`): it refuses a point whose base PPL is above `--family-max-ppl`
(default 10), records a control base with the fallback arm at `--control-ub` (default 256), always prints
the control, and passes on the absolute limits or on "no worse than the control".  Record the op-level
NMSE pair too.  This is not a license for within-family changes: those still meet 0.005 / 98 % at the
default point.

**Historical correction.**  The r102 numbers that motivated this campaign were the *marginal* pair measured
against the delivery without the 512 rows (`0.0293 / 92.59 %`), while the fully-tile absolute pair is
`0.0462 / 90.42 %` — and the delivery's own head-256 rows already cost `0.0441 / 90.63 %` against fully
tile.  The `WORKLOG` 261021.004 line labels the marginal pair "head-512 WMMA vs tile".
